||37||098||Bianca||So... you're the one in charge of rescuing the eggs, huh? Heh heh heh... How sad... Look here, dragon, if you know what's good for you, you'll turn around and crawl back up that hole you came through. Those eggs belong to us now, and I've hidden them in places you'll never find in a thousand years! Besides, even if you could find an egg, our expertly trained armies will dispose of you and take it back. Do I make myself clear? If I find you here again, I am going to be verrrrry angry... and you won't like me when I'm angry...|| 
||38||128||Cpl. Gabrielle||Sir! The rhynocs have blocked the way out of this next cave with a security door, and I don't think you'll be able to blast your way through this one. Recommend you land on the weights and carry them to the pressure sensitive security switches either side of the door. When in position press the > button to drop the weight. Press the } button once to look down, press it again to look up, sir! &[Land on item to pick it up. &[The > button drops item. &[Use the } button to change views.|| 
||39||134||Bianca||Listen to me, dragon... Spyro... this is serious now. The Sorceress is planning a trap for you, and if she catches you... believe me, you don't want to know what she's going to do... Look, I promise to take good care of the rest of the eggs. I mean it. Just take Hunter and go back home before... before... I can't say it, just go!|| 
||40||170||Hunter||Check it out, this is the world's fastest turbo-snowboard course! The local champions are the Sasquatch Six, a gang of yeti's on souped up snow-discs. I bet that you could outrace the lot of 'em! If you win, we get a huge pile of treasure! If you lose, I have to slick down the whole course with my tongue.||
||41||120||Hunter||Wow, you learn really fast! Then again, you are being trained by a master boarder... Speaking of which, I was just practicing a nearly impossible new move that I call the 'Gnasty Gnorc'. I had almost pulled it off when I suddenly ran smack into this dragon egg and wiped out! OK, I made that up, but you can have this egg...||
||42||152||Moneybags||Don't worry, Spyro, I won't be needing any more of your money... Now, now, don't look so surprised! I found one of the dragon eggs, and I'm going to sell it for a fortune back in Avalar! Errr... uh oh... why are you looking at me like that? I... errr... heh heh... I've got to be going now! Toodles!||
||43||098||Moneybags||Spyro! My my, how funny to see you here! Why, I haven't seen you since we defeated Ripto in Avalar... heh heh... Well, my business went into a slump after you left, so I came here and struck up a nice deal with the local Sorceress. Lovely woman, she is. Seems to be very fond of dragons, too...||
||44||148||Bentley||This might be our last stand, Spyro. The Sorceress plans to use this monster to destroy every iota of her opposition, beginning with the two of us. Alas, there is no time for ruminating, a battle awaits us... I will endeavor to assist you by means of a steady provision of combustible projectiles.||
||45||110|| _{xxx}_ the Mountain Goat||Those rhynocs have taken over! There'll be no stopping them unless we can smash their huts. Their huts are too big to smash with your kick attack, though. Try using your Stomp attack to smash them instead. I'll confuse them with taunting, while you stomp the huts, OK? _{xxx}_ ||
||46||120||Mowat||I was playing catch with my pet wolf, Farley, but I accidentally threw his ball down this hole and he went in after it. Now he's stuck down there. I feel so helpless... sitting up here... listening to his steadily softening whimpers... don't cry, wolf... never cry, wolf...||
||47||154||Moneybags||Hmph... These gnomes think they're so talented... I happen to know a pretty good magic trick, myself! It's called the... incredible... magical... err, extending bridge trick. However, you'll need a few more gems to make a donation... After all, I am just a poor, starving amateur magician... &[Crossing bridge costs ^^^^ gems.||
||48||142||Princess Ami||Ohh... hee hee... Hi, Spyro! Isn't Prince Azrael just the dreamiest? The other fairies and wizards won't let us get married, so we're going to elope! ... By the way, Azrael says you can have this egg if you don't tell anyone where we went!||
||49||136||Moneybags||Say, Spyro, you're a sports fan aren't you? As you probably know, Frozen Altars is the birthplace of the great sport of cat hockey. Today's match is sold out, of course, but I just happen to have a spare ticket that I'll sell you for... say... a teensy weensy markup...||
||50||114||Zoe||Are you paying attention Sparx? I told you to use slide to target those crawdads. If you don't learn how to use all your skills you'll never survive the challenges that lie ahead, and Spyro would never forgive me for that. Use the @4L1@0 or @4R1@0 button, then move with the analog stick or directional button.||
||51||142||Sgt. Byrd||Good day, Spyro! I'd like to stay and chat, but I'm late for a... err... an engagement with a fairy friend of mine... err... she's just a friend, you understand... it's a strictly platonic relationship... it's certainly not a violation of military protocol whatsoever... What? What are you giving me that look for?||
||52||156||Gus||Hello, you must be Spyro! A lot of people are talking about all the things you've done for them... Do you think you could help find my girlfriend, Tara? She went off to raid the Tomb of the Stone Golem, and I haven't seen her since. I'd go look inside the tomb myself, but, you know, there's all these scorpions and stuff.||
||53||116||Bianca||Okay, dragon, you've managed to survive longer than I expected... but you haven't the slightest idea what sort of dangers lie ahead of you! I suggest you grab your cat friend and whatever eggs you have found and high-tail it back home while you still can... I'm telling you this for your own good, you know...||
||54||158||Dan||Ahhh, yet another dare-devil adventurer has come to rob our catacombs of loot! Let's just hope you're made of tougher stuff than the last guy... If you can survive the trials of our catacombs and answer my riddle, we will give you a prize befitting your efforts.||
||55||160||Sheriff Wyatt||Well, gosh darn it Spyro. I came in here to check on my prisoner only to find out he'd somehow got away again. Then, when I came in to look around for clues, one o' them rowdy dinosaurs went and locked me in. Now they're out there causin' all sorts o' trouble and there's not a thing I can do about it.||
||56||156||Moneybags||Well, Spyro, I bet you're glad to see me! It just happens that I know the, err... password to open the door to the Tomb of the Stone Golem... but, err... it seems to have slipped my mind for the moment... if you know what I mean.||
||57||120||Ooga||Spyro! Are you on vacation too? I was having a lovely time with my friend until the lava toads stole all his bones again. I'd ask you to help, but some of the toads are hiding at the top of the tallest towers and I don't think you can fly that high.||
||58||114||Zoe||On your travels you'll notice butterflies that give you health, just like in the Dragon Worlds. Not only that but some butterflies will give you special powers, though only for a short time. Just eat any powerup butterfly and then press the < button to use that powerup. Your powerup is shown in the top right of the screen.||
||59||152||Moneybags||Hello there, Spyro, how do you like my new space monkey action figure? Incredibly life-like, don't you think? You'd almost think he was actually intelligent, heh heh. I suppose I might consider selling him to you... but you'll have to come up with a bit more cash first.||
||60||128||Cpl. Gabrielle||Sir! The situation is this, yesterday at 1845 hours the rhynocs invaded. We defended as best we could, sir, but without your leadership we didn't put up an effective resistance. By 1900 hours the rest of the squad was captured and the rhynocs had complete control of the base.||
||61||Sparx||
||62||Sparx||
||63||142||Isabelle||Where have you been, James? We were supposed to meet in the temple an hour ago! And don't give me that old 'matters of national security' line again! ... I guess it doesn't matter, though... the whole temple is full of nasty cat witches, anyway. We'll just have to call off our date... that is, unless you want to battle the witches...||
||64||118||Nancy||Tonight is my big ice dance performance, and these hockey players are ruining it! Every time I start my routine, they come in and smack me with their sticks. Oh, I sure wish I had a partner... someone courageous and strong and handsome and... purple... who breathes fire...||
||65||120||Hunter||I can't believe it! How did you get so good already? Who knows, someday you might even break my course record. Naw. Anyway, I guess I should give you this other egg I found. I was going to keep it for a pet, but I can't get it to hatch.||
||66||162||Hunter||Where do these flying sheep saucers keep coming from? I just saw another one grab an egg and fly off! This one's super fast, but his saucer is damaged and it's leaving smoke rings... I think I can keep up with him as long as I can make it through the rings...||
||67||152||Moneybags||...pant pant... Drat! ...pant pant... Double drat! ...pant pant... Drat drat drat drat drat drat drat! ... pant pant... I never knew dragons were so fast... That's it... I give up... I'm retiring to Spooky Swamp to become a haiku poet...||
||68||158||Ali||Behind this door lie the five deadly trials of King Rover. No one has ever survived all five. In fact, it is so dangerous that I cannot let you through this first door unless you are able to solve my riddle...||
||69||158||Agent 9||One of those dogs with the funny hats put a curse on me, just 'cause I shot him in the butt a couple times. He said he turned my tail into a snake. Does it look like a snake to you? It does feel kinda funny, come to think of it. Hoo boy, that dog's gonna pay!||
||70||152||Bianca||Spyro, I know you don't trust me, but I want to help you stop the Sorceress. There's a way to open a hidden portal to her lair, but it'll take some very strong magic... If you can find more of the dragon eggs, I think my magic will be strong enough to open the portal. I'll come find you when you have enough eggs, okay?||
||71||098||Moneybags||I'm getting paid a fortune to keep Sheila the Kangaroo locked up... heh heh... the pesky animal must have been causing a lot of trouble for that poor Sorceress... I suppose I could accidentally let the kangaroo escape... if you were to pay me, say...a small fee. &Pay ^^^ gems to free Sheila? &Sure. &No thanks.||
||72||164||Moneybags||Ooooooh weeee, I love the sizzle of a high energy laser on the back end of a rhynoc. Too bad the Sorceress didn't send more of 'em, I was really getting into the zone. Well, now that my island is safe again I guess I'll have to go rhynoc hunting elsewhere... Are you headed out?||
||73||154||Moneybags||Spyro, did you know I happen to be a very talented amateur magician? My specialty is the, err... 'Amazing Extending Bridge' trick. I'd love to show you, but I need a small donation first... for my expenses, you understand...||
||74||156||Tara||Well, well, look at you... showing up here to raid the tomb, after I've done all the work. I spend all day pressing switches and shoving boxes around, and you just waltz in here expecting to claim the treasure! Well, you might as well have it. It only turned out to be a lousy egg, anyway.||
||75||134||Bentley||I believe the denizens of this land plan to create a rocket propulsion device of some kind in order to help you with your journey. I'll try to be of some assistance, but I'm afraid you'll still need a representative from each world in order to complete the device.||
||76||114||Zoe||Now for the hard part. Being a maneuverable dragonfly, you can also slide in any direction. To slide, hold down the @4L1@0 or @4R1@0 button, then move with the analog stick or directional button. Try sliding up and down to hit the targets in this room.||
||77||164||Agent 9||What was that? Did you see a rhynoc? I thought I saw a rhynoc! Oooooh, take it from me, Spyro, never spend a week in a cage.  Uh, huh, next thing you know your whole island will be knee deep in rhynocs. Well, gotta go, Mr. Laser Blaster and I have a whole lotta work to do.||
||78||118||Moneybags||Just between you and me, Spyro, I'd love to let you into the ice dancing competition for free. Really, I would. Unfortunately, however, the upkeep on my zamboni is costing a fortune, so I'll have to ask you to find more gems before I let you in.||
||79||120||Jasper||I'm almost ready to reveal my latest piece of real-time, four-dimensional performance art! I call it 'Hideous Exploding Witch, Number 9'. Now, if you can just light the three rockets around here, my masterpiece shall be complete...||
||80||098||Hunter||I see an egg at the bottom of this lake. I would go get it, but I don't want to get my fur all wet. Maybe you could get it. You can dive underwater by pressing the > button when you're on the surface, and charge underwater by holding down the > button.||
||81||102||Moneybags||Sorry, Spyro, it is my sworn duty to make certain no one crosses these bellows. And you know perfectly well that nothing could ever sway me from obeying my sworn duty... that is, ahem, until you have a few more gems.||
||82||120||Hunter||Now that was a 900! I have to admit, you've got some skills, Spyro. But before you get too cocky, let's see if you can score some real points on the giant ski ramp. Do whatever moves you want, and see how many points you can get.||
||83||116||Moneybags||Ahh, my good friend Spyro. The Sorceress caught this naughty bird letting off rockets in her fireworks factory, but I'm willing to release him into your custody... provided you pay his outstanding fines.||
||84||-||-||-||
||85||170||Hunter||YEEESSSSSSS! You schooled 'em like a bunch of frost-bitten, flat-footed, molasses-eating, lead-pants-wearing, cross-eyed glacier-trolls riding slabs of plywood with sandpaper on the bottom!!! ... And we won some shiny stuff, too.||
||86||120||Hunter||Hey, nice roll! Now let's see you pull a flip. Flips are exactly like rolls, only you push up or down instead of left or right. Just jump off the ramp, hold down the } button, and push up or down on the directional pad.||
||87||104||Moneybags||Spyro, you're just in time! I saw two egg thieves run through this door! Well... actually, they paid me to guard their hideout, but that's irrelevant. I'll happily let you through the gate to chase them down... for, ahem, a small finder's fee...||
||88||136||Moneybags||Head on in, Spyro, it should be a thrilling match! In fact... heh heh.. I've even placed a little wager on the rhynoc team... let's just hope the local team doesn't have any last minute accidents...||
||89||138||Hunter||Spyro, you're just in time! A rhynoc skateboard gang has challenged us to a race. They said you're slower than a Molten Crater fire slug. I stuck up for you, though! I told them I've seen some pretty fast fire slugs.||
||90||106||Sebastian the Seal||While I was gone, my friends borrowed the rhynocs' submarine... then they took it for a joy ride... and then they smashed it into a big pile of rocks. Oddly enough, the rhynocs failed to see the humor in the story and stuffed my friends in the jail behind you.||
||91||Sparx||
||92||120||Hunter||This one's freestyle, Spyro! Do whatever tricks you want off the ramp. If you jump off the ramp, you can do half-pipe moves. If you don't jump off the ramp, you can do rolls and flips. The harder the trick, the more points you'll score. &[Score 500 points on the giant ski ramp &[Jump on ramp to do half-pipe moves. &[Don't jump on ramp to do rolls and flips.||
||93||156||Hunter||Nice shootin', comrade! Where'd you learn to aim like that? Oh, by the way, Bianca wanted me to give you this egg. She says she accidentally turned it into a woolly mammoth for five minutes, but it should still be ok.||
||94||098||Hunter||Yo, Spyro! I just found one of those portal thingamajigs that leads to a different world, but you'll have to glide to get across to it. Press the < button to jump, then press the < button again while you're in the air to glide! Just follow me... &[Press < button to jump. &[Press < button in mid-air to glide.||
||95||154||The Great Zamboni||Would you like to see a magic trick? Watch carefully, as you can see there is nothing up my left sleeve, nothing up my right sleeve, but now with a wave of my hands and the magic word... ALAKAZAM!||
||96||152||Moneybags||Well, well, Spyro, look what I have here. It's a life-size space monkey action figure, complete with a fully operational laser! I'd love to let him out so you can play with him, but the Sorceress seems to think he's a menace.||
||97||124||Ling Ling||Spyro! Rhynocs have been harassing us all day. The workers haven't been able to harvest the bamboo needed for the whirligig to take you to Evening Lake. We've tried asking them to leave, but there's no reasoning with them.||
||98||104||Moneybags||Well, Spyro, it's good to see you! This gate I'm guarding happens to be the secret entrance to an egg thief hideout... Of course, I can't let you enter with a clean conscience... At least not without paying a small fee.||
||99||102||Moneybags||Well, well, if it isn't my favorite dragon! The Sorceress has put me in charge of guarding these bellows. However, I suppose I might look the other way if I was distracted by counting gems.||
||100||Sparx||
||101||???||Sparx||
||102||170||Hunter||Hi, Spyro! Did you see Bianca? She was really worried about you when you went off to fight the Sorceress. It was pretty funny. She tries to play it cool, but she was scared stiff until you came back safe.||
||103||Sparx||
||104||140||Greta||Oh hewwo, it's good to see you again, Spywo. That naughty sorcewess has stolen the pwofessor's wocket plans and I'm on a secwet mission to find them. Handel was supposed to meet me here but I can't find him anywhere. Maybe you could help?||
||105||Sparx||
||106||098||Zoe||Hi Spyro. To look left or right, press the @4L2@0 or @4R2@0 buttons. To quickly center the camera behind you, press the @4L1@0 or @4R1@0 button. You can look all around by holding the } button down.||
||107||140||Handel||Hi, Agent 9! Behind those doors are some pwetty scary ninjas! I bet you could use your sharp shooter skills to take them out. Wemember, pwess the { button to shoot and use @4L1@0 and @4R1@0 to dodge left and wight.||
||108||138||Crazy Ed||Hoooohoooo, at last, the acid lake is safe fer swimmin' agin'! I wish I could re-ward ya better, but all I gots left is dis 'ere other egg. Maybe dere'll be something better in dis one.||
||109||158||Jamal||That was indeed a battle for the ages! You're the first dragon to win the competition in over a thousand years. I proudly present you this year's grand prize...||
||110||120||Mowat||Hey, you found Farley! How can I ever thank you? I mean, I could give you this old egg, but Farley's been chewing on it and it's kinda slimey... oh well, it's the thought that counts, right?||
||111||116||Zoe||Hi Spyro. This is a superflame powerup. You'll find more just like it scattered throughout all the worlds. Why don't you try this one out by using it to break all these planters. I think I saw a rhynoc hide an egg in one of them.||
||112||120||Hunter||Whoa, you must be a natural! Now let's see if you can pull off a half-pipe spin move. The blue ramps are half-pipes. You can do a spin move by jumping at the top of the blue ramp, then steering left or right in the air.||
||113||130||Sgt. Byrd||My tactical instincts told me the Sorceress would attack you here, so I flew in to help out. It seems my rocket launchers don't affect this creature, but I can assist you by dropping ammunition. Now get in there and fight the good fight!||
||114||164||Professor||Ahh, Agent 9, my favorite pupil... welcome back to my island laboratory! I'm afraid rhynocs have taken over the whole island... perhaps you could stop them before they destroy all my research.||
||115||154||The Marvelous Magnifico||Shhh! Spyro, don't tell anyone but we've stolen some magic from the Sorceress. We're hiding here whilst we practice using it. Unfortunately we've had a bit of an accident and turned everything into crystal, and it seems to have aggravated the indiginous creatures.||
||116||170||Bianca||Your best chance to defeat her is to borrow my flying saucer. I've cast some spells on it to give it extra firepower and unlimited flying time... but the rest is going to be up to you... You've come this far, Spyro, I know you can beat her!||
||117||116||Zoe||Excellent work Sparx, and I see that you've gained another new ability. Now if you hold down the @4L1,L2, R1 and R2@0 buttons at the same time, Sparx will point to any treasure still hanging around.||
||118||Sparx||
||119||152||Zoe||That last egg must have had some extra magic, because it gave Sparx two new abilities. Now he can break open treasure chests, and, using the Atlas, he can warp you to any level. Just select the level you want and press the > button.||
||120||138||Hunter||Now that the rhynocs are gone, do you want to try a real challenge? I know you're fast, but I bet you can't defeat all the crabs on the course and still beat me in a race! Want to give it a shot?||
||121||106||Smelt the Seal||Bluto the rhynoc has challenged us to a naval battle. Our speed boat versus his nuclear shark submarine. If we win, we get the dragon egg he's guarding. If we lose, we have to spend a month in K.P.||
||122||138||Hunter||Sheesh, I can't believe you beat me! You must have been practicing the whole time I thought you were looking for eggs... Hey, speaking of which, one of those crabs was guarding this one...||
||123||120||Hunter||You can go for the course record now, if you want. Whenever you hop on a skateboard, a timer will start. Score as many points as you can until the timer expires or you wipe out. Good luck!||
||124||158||Jamal||You may now enter the championship round... However, this is an exceedingly dangerous sport. Might I suggest you quit while you're still in one piece?||
||125||138||Hunter||Right on! You can use my special racing board. Every time you do a trick, it builds up turbo charge. You can use your turbos at any time by pressing the > button. Good luck!||
||126||104||Shale||I'm playing a game of hide and seek with my friends. If I can't find where they've hidden their heads they won't let me join the Tiki Lodge. Help me put them back together and I'll make you an honorary member.||
||127||098||Zoe||Nice work Sparx! You've beaten the Crawdad King and found the lost egg. Not only that but some of the dragon magic seems to have rubbed off on you. Now you can pick up gems when they're even further away from Spyro.||
||128||158||Jamal||Oooh, I am terribly sorry, but that is incorrect. Unless you can solve the riddle, we cannot trust you behind the controls of something so dangerous as a fully loaded demolition hovercraft.||
||129||Sparx||
||130||158||Dan||Here is my riddle:\ I am a vessel without hinges, lock or lid,\ yet, within my walls, a golden treasure is hid.\ What am I?||
||131||136||Moneybags||Off you go, then... But you'll regret it... Many years from now you'll sit on your old dragon haunches and wish with all your might that you could have just one more chance to see a game of cat hockey...||
||132||110||Billy the Mountain Goat||You can get up really steep cliffs like this one with your double-jump. Press the < button to jump, then press it again exactly when you hit the ground to do the double-jump. Once you've mastered it, you can go anywhere you want!||
||133||106||Snappy the Seal||Hi, Sheila! The rhynocs have built a fortress on our beach and we're going to blow it to smithereens! We just need you to take out all the turrets for us. We're lighting the bomb now, just make sure to stomp all those turrets before the fuse runs out, OK?||
||134*||098||Zoe||I'm sorry, Spyro, but you seem to be playing a hacked version of this game. This may be an illegal copy. Since this copy has been modified, you may experience problems that would not occur on a legal copy.||
||135||170||Bianca||This place is where the Sorceress kept all her treasure, but after she was defeated a bunch of thieves came and stole it. If you can catch the thieves, you're more than welcome to keep the treasure!||
||136||122||Moneybags||\           You've made a wise choice...\        It will mean more eggs for you...\              And more gems for me. \           Best of all, Spyro...\        I can stop speaking Haiku.\           What a sweet relief!||
||137||138||Crazy Ed||Alrighty then. Press the < button to speed on up, and when you get a sub in your sights, the torpedo will start to lock on. If you get a good lock-on, fire away with the { button. &[Press < to speed up.||
||138||120||Hunter||You can go for the course record now, if you want. Whenever you hop on a skateboard, a timer will start. Score as many points as you can until the timer expires or you wipe out. Good luck!||
||139||164||Professor||There's another door at the end of this beach, and rhynocs will keep coming out until you shoot the red panic button. Work your way up the beach by dodging and using the natural cover on the right side.||
||140||156||Moneybags||I am dreadfully sorry, Spyro, but I can't let common riff raff into the Tomb of the Stone Golem. Only the crustiest of the upper crust may pass through here.||
||141||Sparx||
||142||Sparx||
||143||152||Bianca||You did it, Spyro! You found enough of the dragon eggs for me to unlock the portal. Once I've opened it, you can confront the Sorceress whenever you're ready... but be careful, she'll be expecting you...||
||144||Sparx||
||145||164||Professor||These indicators show that a bunch of rhynocs are hiding behind the display screen. I'll switch on the view pedestal, and you shoot them as they attack! I recommend using your sniper mode.||
||146||Sparx||
||147||138||Crazy Ed||Well, I hate t' ask yer help again, but dere be even more subs that durn come outta nowheres. If you could blast 'em, I could use dis acid lake as muh swimmin' hole again.||
||148||164||Professor||The lab's clear, and it smells better in here already! Follow me outside, where I expect we'll find some rhynocs wearing armor. You'll need a more powerful weapon to defeat them.||
||149||Sparx||
||150||164||Professor||Just as I thought, the machine room is overrun with birds. To target the birds in their nests, you'll want to use sniper mode, then zoom in for pinpoint accuracy. &[Press the } button to enter sniper mode.||
||151||116||Moneybags||Heh heh... what a sucker... err, that is... It's a far, far better thing you do today, Spyro, than you have ever done, and... err... well so forth, et cetera, you get the idea...||
||152||118||Moneybags||Step right up, Spyro. Behind this door is the single greatest show on earth! That's right! Ice dancing! Season tickets are available, but you'll have to act fast.||
||153||122||Basho the Firefly||\           We have the bombs here.\         We must destroy the egg cage.\             But we just go boom.\ \           Kangaroo can help!\        You can clear the path for us!\           Will Sheila help us?||
||154||122||Buson the Firefly||\           We have the bombs here.\         We must destroy the egg cage.\             But we just go boom.\ \           Kangaroo can help!\        You can clear the path for us!\           Will Sheila help us?||
||155||142||Isabelle||You did it, James!!! I knew you weren't the leader of the Hummingbird Resistance Movement for nothing! Now we have the temple all to ourselves... but first, I have a present for you...||
||156||134||Moneybags||Where are you getting all this money, Spyro? ... heh heh... It's not just lying around on the ground, is it? ...err... is it? Ahh, what do I care, it's mine now!||
||157||144||Hunter||Look out, Spyro, there's a really big sheep UFO around here, and it's trying to get me! I snatched up a dragon egg it was trying to abduct, and now it wants revenge!||
||158||142||Moneybags||Well, Spyro, today is your lucky day! The wizards and I have worked out a little deal. If you simply pay a small toll, they'll be happy to raise these steps and let you pass.||
||159||134||Moneybags||Heh heh, the Sorceress has a real prize on her hands here... it took two dozen rhynocs to capture this dimwitted furball, so you'd better believe he's not going to get out cheap...||
||160||120||Hunter||Flips are my signature move! Just jump off the ramp, hold down the } button, and push up or down on the directional pad. Try doing a flip and landing on the next ramp.||
||161||100||Hunter||Alright, if you can catch all the lizards without wiping out and before time runs out, I  might be able to scrounge up another egg. It's not gonna be easy, though...||
||162||
||163||Sparx||
||164||142||Liz||Spyro, we urgently need your help! The evil cat wizards of Felinia have stormed our castle and captured our princess! If we don't stop them right away, they'll force her to marry Prince Azrael!||
||165||Sparx||
||166||098||Hunter||To get the best glide distance, press the < button while walking forward, then press it again at the top of your jump. Finally, press the } button just before you get to the landing to hover.||
||167||098||Snappy the Seal||Here I was, about to go for a nice swim at Shell Beach, and my portal just disappeared right in front of me. If you go find some more of those dragon eggs, I bet this portal would turn on again.||
||168||102||Moneybags||Oooooh yes... precious, precious gems... Well then, Spyro, you may now use the bellows any time you wish. Best of luck on your little egg hunt. Well, well, if it isn't my favorite dragon! The Sorceress has put me in charge of guarding these bellows. However, I suppose I might look the other way if I was distracted by counting gems.||
||169||146||Moneybags||I will gladly help you on your quest, Spyro, but first I must attend to my young sibling. I'm afraid he may have gotten himself into trouble during my absence.||
||170||164||Professor||A vast number of rhynocs are waiting to ambush us as soon as I lower this force field. I expect they'll keep coming until you shoot the red panic button next to the door where they come out.||
||171||158||Jamal||The first round of the annual demolition hovercraft competition is about to begin! There is room for one more contestant, but you'll have to answer a riddle to qualify.||
||172||138||Crazy Ed||Dese here waters used to be my favorite divin' spot, but I can't get any loot with dese subs patrollin' around. Think you kin pilot dis here sub I bought for scrap?||
||173||114||Zoe||You'll be able to deal with these guys much faster if you use the powerup. Just eat any powerup butterfly and then press the < button to use that powerup. Your powerup is shown in the top right of the screen.||
||174||114||Zoe||Hello Sparx, maybe before you take on the nasty crawdads I should give you some help. To start let's practice shooting. Press the { button to shoot these targets.||
||175||158||Jamal||The riddle is this:\ If one dragon can lay one egg in twelve years, how long would it take for 100 dragons to lay 100 eggs? ||
||176||120||Jasper||And now, for my latest experiment: 'Blast-Sculpting'! I shall attempt to carve an image of you with a single explosive detonation...||
||177||120||Jasper||The world breathlessly awaits my brilliant four-dimensional masterpiece... just light all the rockets and prepare to be amazed by my genius!||
||178||142||Moneybags||Say, Spyro, if you had a bit more money, I think I could make a deal with the wizards to raise these steps. I'm afraid that's the only way you'll be able to get to the castle.||
||179||136||Ernest||Eustace and I were having a snowman building competition when the Sorceress brought them to life with a spell. Since then they've been stomping around building ice walls and generally causing trouble.||
||180||
||181||098||Moneybags||The Sorceress has asked me to guard Sheila the Kangaroo. I suppose, if you had a bit more money, I'd be willing to let her escape. Then you could keep her for a pet or something.||
||182||098||Moneybags||Ahhh, Spyro, I love your sweet naivete... Your kind-hearted nature might be your downfall someday, but for the time being it's making me rich!||
||183||098||Hunter||There's definitely something shiny at the bottom of this hole. I was about to jump down there, but I think I hear running water and I hate to get wet. It's a cat thing.||
||184||
||185||142||Jack||I just bought some insta-sprout-ultra-super-grow seeds from a bear with a bag of gems. He said they were magic, but I can't make them do anything. You can have a couple, if you like.||
||186||110||Billy the Mountain Goat||Hiya Sheila! While you were gone, a bunch of rhynocs kicked us out of our houses. It's OK though... Bobby, Pete and I are working on a clever plan to take them back.||
||187||152||Moneybags||You don't want to free him? Ahhh, what's the matter, little dragon? Are you just jealous that no one has ever made an action figure out of you?||
||188||164||Professor||Ah, it'll be just like old times! Try shooting these dummies to get warmed up, but... err, be careful, I think a rhynoc might be hiding among them...||
||189||154||The Astounding Arturo||Well, I suppose I could show you my new trick. As long as you promise not to tell the Great Zamboni, he steals all my best work... ALAKAZAM!||
||190||Sparx||
||191||118||Nancy||Uh...that's OK. I don't mind getting beaten to a pulp over and over by a bunch of vicious hockey players. I'm sure you have more important things to do anyway.||
||192||Sparx||
||193||Sparx||
||194||142||Moneybags||Suit yourself, Spyro... but every time I think of that poor, poor fairy princess being captured by those villainous wizards, I simply break down in tears.||
||195||134||Princess Ami||I've always been really good with machinery. In fact, if you get me a little more help, I could whip up a rocketship in no time. But hurry, OK? I want to get back to my honeymoon!||
||196||138||Crazy Ed||Be careful, roun' dese parts, li'l dragon! Dere be more ghosts in dis here shipyard den I kin shake me pick at! Durned shame, too, 'cause I was mighty close tuh findin' me treasure.||
||197||104||Moneybags||Very well, Spyro, it's up to you... Maybe if we both just hold hands and think happy thoughts, the thieves will decide to return the eggs themselves||
||198||134||Zoe||When I saw that giant stingray I thought you were a goner, Sparx, but you sure showed him. Now the magic from the egg has made you even stronger, so you can take one more hit for Spyro.||
||199||152||Zoe||Just before you kicked the Sorceress's big, fat, ugly butt she built a factory to make robotic bugs to fight Sparx, but I don't think they're any match for him.||
||200||120||Hunter||Isn't this the wildest skateboard park you've ever seen? Once you've mastered a few tricks, you could score huge points in this place! What do you say I show you some moves? &Learn some tricks?||
||201||134||Moneybags||Good grief, dragon, what happened to all your money? How am I supposed to swindle... err.. heh heh... help you, if you can't even find any gems!||
||202||142||Isabelle||I must admit, James, I am impressed... There are still a few witches left, though, and this time they mean business! They even turned the floor into deadly blue ooze. Oh, be careful, ok?||
||203||142||Isabelle||So, I see those rocket launchers aren't just for show after all... Well, I just hope your accuracy is better than your punctuality, because there are still a lot more witches in the temple.||
||204||138||Hunter||Sheesh, what happened? I could beat these guys with my tail tied behind my back! I hope you do better this time, or we'll never live it down...||
||205||124||Shui||Please help us Spyro! My friends are trying to go home after a long shift in the fields, but rotten rhynocs keep knocking them down. Can you save the panda workers?||
||206||Sparx||
||207||142||Moneybags||You know, come to think of it, the wizards only agreed to raise the steps. They never said they wouldn't lower them again... heh heh... Those guys are pretty clever, aren't they?||
||208||156||Hunter||What, you're not afraid of a few robotic sharks, are you? Or is it the rhynocs with ultra-explosive JX-5 tracking ammo that have you worried?||
||209||158||Allgeier||I am a vessel without hinges, lock or lid,\ yet, within my walls, a golden treasure is hid.\ What am I?||
||210||160||Deputy Roy||I don't know why the Bailey gang was trying so hard to steal this egg, that's not like them at all. I reckon someone must have put them up to it.||
||211||156||Hunter||What, you're not afraid of a few robotic sharks, are you? Or is it the rhynocs with ultra-explosive JX-5 tracking ammo that have you worried?||
||212||118||Doug||Heh heh... I put up ice blocks this morning so Bob wouldn't beat me to the ice fishing hole... If you want to try out the hole, you can borrow this fishing lure I've been using.||
||213||118||Nancy||We did it! That was my best performance ever! I guess one of the judges didn't like it, though. He threw this egg at me instead of a rose. Why don't you have it.||
||214||100||Hunter||Now that you've mastered the basics, let's see you do some stunts! Try using the < or } button to jump off ramps and turn in the air...||
||215||134||Zoe||Hi again, Spyro. This powerup can make you invincible, but only for a short while. Use it to get by these flame spitters... you'll find an egg when you get past them.||
||216||158||Allgeier||I've waited seven thousand years for someone to solve that riddle... Now I can finally head off to Seashell Shore to bury some bones!||
||217||170||Bianca||I don't know how she did it, Spyro, but the Sorceress must have survived that last battle! She's been waiting here all this time, saving up her magic to destroy you!||
||218||126||Hunter||Spyro, you're not gonna believe this, but there are sheep saucers and space cows all over this place! We gotta stop 'em before they abduct anybody!||
||219||152||Zoe||Sparx can help you find the rest of the gems. When you hold down @4L1, L2, R1, and R2@0 at the same time, he will point to the nearest treasure in that area.||
||220||098||Moneybags||Well, don't worry, Spyro. Sheila won't stay in jail forever... The Sorceress is thinking about having her executed next Thursday.||
||221||106||Sheila||Oh, hi, Spyro! Some of my seal friends are trying to take down a rhynoc fortress! I'm about to go and lend a foot... I love the smell of singed rhynoc in the morning!||
||222||158||Ali||Here's the riddle:\ I follow you wherever you go,\ but the more of me you take,\ the more you leave behind.\||
||223||156||Sheila||Hi, Spyro! Haven't seen you in a while. I'm just off for a bit of a walkabout, right now. You know, sometimes you just long for the simple, old-fashioned pleasures of yesteryear, doncha?||
||224||134||Bentley||Hop aboard, Spyro, and boldly go where no dragon has gone before! Well, at least not in a thousand years, at any rate...||
||225||114||Zoe||You can also move quickly by charging, like Spyro. To charge, hold down the > button. Use your charge to chase down this fast enemy.||
||226||158||Ali||I'm sorry, my simian friend, but that was not even close. Perhaps you would prefer to go play with a nice bouncy ball.||
||227||156||Moneybags||It's just as well, I've heard there are enough riches inside this tomb to pay a dragon's ransom... err... so to speak.||
||228||104||Zoe||Be sure to keep your friend Sparx the Dragonfly healthy Spyro. If his health is low, torch a little creature like this slug below me to release a butterfly.||
||229||158||Jamal||My my, such a brave reptile you are... but you'll need much more than bravery to win the championship...||
||230||158||Jamal||Well, well, that was a fierce battle indeed... Please accept this prize for winning the first round...||
||231||120||Pablo||Yup, that exploding Sorceress statue was Jasper's finest work since 'Rhynoc with TNT Barrel: Four Seconds of Terror'.||
||232||120||Hunter||This one's cake! Just press the < button to jump off the ramp, then hold down the } button and steer left or right to do a roll.||
||233||142||Jack||pant... pant... I found this egg on the way up here... I think it was laid by a golden goose! We'll have to keep going... We're almost to the top!||
||234||136||Gabrielle||Welcome to Frozen Altars, Spyro! On behalf of the ice fairies, I want to grant you a special power for as long as you stay in our world.||
||235||140||Handel||Uh oh. You'll have to use this combo powerup to take out these fire dwagons. It will allow you to superfwy and superfwame at the same time.||
||236||100||Hunter||Hi Spyro. I found this gladiator training arena and it makes a pretty cool skate park! Care for a test of your boarding skills?||
||237||098||Snappy the Seal||I think something is draining the magic out of the world. They say things have been going downhill ever since the dragons left here a thousand years ago.||
||238||110||XXX the Mountain Goat||Last time we tried to get past this moose, he knocked Billy clean through a wall. If you don't mind, we'll just hang out here while you give him a good kicking.||
||239||110||XXX the Mountain Goat||Hey, Sheila, let's play a joke! Take this egg and smash it on Billy's house, OK? I need to get him back for the last time he butted me off the cliff.||
||240||156||Moneybags||Heh heh, very well then, the password to open the tomb is... are you ready? ... heh heh... 'Gullible'.||
||241||154||The Amazing Randini||I'm afraid my magic show seems to have over excited the moles. They need a good bonk on the head to calm them down, and you look like just the man to help.||
||242||136||Moneybags||You had better hurry up and find some cash, Spyro. Today's cat hockey match is about to start, and I can't let you in without a ticket.||
||243||140||Greta||It looks like you'll have to use this cannon to get across here, simply climb aboard. As for me I just have to fwee my mind...||
||244||136||Errol||I challenged a rhynoc to a traditional game of cat hockey, but I think I sprained my flipper during training. Would you mind taking my place?||
||245||138||Hunter||Yeeesss!! You schooled 'em like a bunch of dizzy, one-toed sand gnorcs! ... Oh yeah, I guess we won this egg, too.||
||246||106||Smelt the Seal||Wow! That's the first time Bluto has ever lost! You've got a lot of talent for someone so purple... I hope this egg was worth all the trouble.||
||247||120||Hunter||The 900 is a little tricky. You have to jump off the top of the blue ramp, do two and a half revolutions, and land again.||
||248||146||Bentley||I will sojourn amongst the worlds and if I find any eggs I'll do my utmost to recover them for you.||
||249||098||Zoe||Spyro, I've found an egg, but only Sparx will be able to reach it. There's a small hole that leads to a crawdad farm. I can take him there if he's ready.||
||250||112||Sheila||When I heard the Sorceress was planning to ambush you, I got here as fast as I could. No worries, though. This wussy green toad will be no match for the two of us!||
||251||102||Zoe||The metal armor those enemies are wearing protects them from your dragon flame. If you hold down the > button, you can defeat them with your charge attack.||
||252||102||Zoe||Your camera is now in 'Active' mode, and will move faster. If you don't like it, come back and see me, or change it yourself by using the Options Menu.||
||253||136||Bentley||Ahh, Spyro. I have just received word from my little brother, he appears to be having some trouble with a yeti.||
||254||158||Ali||My my, you're quite clever for someone with so little fashion sense... You may proceed to the first trial.||
||255||154||Moneybags||Very good. Errr... let's see... 'Hocus Pocus, Zigglety Zen, Make This Bridge Get Long Again!'||
||256||160||Deputy Holiday||One of them dinosaurs threw an egg down this flooded mine shaft. I'd get it back for you, but I ain't such a strong swimmer.||
||257||164||Professor||Nice work, Agent 9! Err, I'm not sure if this is a bird egg or dragon egg... what do you think?||
||258||126||Hunter||Space cows are ferocious, laser-wielding bovines who show no mercy or pity! We've gotta stop them, Spyro!||
||259||116||Hunter||Hey, Spyro! Zoe told me that if we hit that doodad up there, the portal will open. Why don't you try spitting this rock at it?||
||260||120||Ooga||Hello birdy, I was having a lovely vacation with my friend, but he's lost all his bones. Can you find them and put him together?||
||261||136||Eugene||Thanks for helping out, Spyro. Why don't you take this. The rhynocs were trying to fry it with a laser, but you stopped them just in time.||
||262||100||Hunter||I bet you can't catch all fifteen of the lizards running around here... Just come back if you want some boarding tips from the master.||
||263||098||Hunter||Remember, press the > button to dive underwater. Then, when you are under the surface, hold down the > button to charge. ||
||264||098||Cumulus||This is a balloon that will take you to a new land, but we can't use it until you bring back one person from each of the five worlds.||
||265||136||Bartholomew||But.. but my ball bwaaaaa.||
||266||138||Hunter||OK, you beat me Spyro, but you didn't get all the crabs. A dragon of your pedigree should really be able to do both!||
||267||164||Professor||You cleared them out! Let's see what kind of shape the machine room is in... I have a feeling the rhynocs haven't been keeping it too clean.||
||268||120||Hunter||OK, now try doing a roll. You can roll in midair by holding down the } button and steering left or right.||
||269||144||Hunter||Ha ha! Did you see that? Nobody outraces a cheetah! And look, I didn't even drop the egg!||
||270||152||Zoe||This portal has been sealed with the strongest magic I've ever seen. You'll need all the dragon eggs and all the gems from each world to break the seal.||
||271||114||Zoe||That looked like it hurt, maybe you should have tried to shoot them like I told you. Just press the { button to shoot the targets.||
||272||118||Nancy||Will you please help me perform my ice dance? These mean rhynoc hockey players keep hogging the ice and all I want to do is dance.||
||273||138||Crazy Ed||Well, I'll be durned! You've got some mean sub-drivin' skills. Why don't you 'ave dis here egg as a re-ward.||
||274||136||Eustace||An ice block, yeah that's what you need to reach that treasure. Now how are we going to get one around here?||
||275||106||Sandy the Seal||This egg has surprisingly good fluid dynamic characteristics. From now on, all of our submarines will be egg-shaped.||
||276||102||Cumulus||Now that's what I call a sun! Here, you can have this last sun seed as a souvenir. I think it might be a dud, though.||
||277||104||Shale||When you find a head, land on top of it to pick it up. Then fly it over to an idol body to put them back together.||
||278||102||Zoe||Remember, to get your longest glide press the < button at the very top of your jump, and use the } button to hover at the end of your jump.||
||279||154||The Marvelous Magnifico||Acrabadabar...no...acrabadadoo...no, no, that isn't right. Just hold on a minute I'll get it.||
||280||154||Moneybags||You shouldn't anger a magician, Spyro. I just might decide to turn you into a blue hedgehog or something.||
||281||156||Hunter||Just watch out for the shark riders. They're carrying the latest JX-5 underwater tracking ammunition.||
||282||146||Bartholomew||Pushing that block is easy for a big guy like you. Just stand next to the block and push forward on the directional button.||
||283||122||Basho/Buson the Firefly||OW...\           I went boom again.\    Big rocks can be kicked, they say,\        Mushrooms must be stomped. &Help the twin?||
||284||122||Basho/Buson the Firefly||OW...\           I went boom again.\    Big rocks can be kicked, they say,\        Mushrooms must be stomped. &Help the twin?||
||285||140||Handel||I think I can see an egg behind you, but it's out of weach. You'll have to take the long way wound through all these whynocs to get to it.||
||286||142||Jack||OK, best of luck! These here thinking puzzles are too tough for me. I prefer action gameplay.||
||287||104||Shale||When you've picked up a tiki head, fly over to any body and use the > button to drop the tiki head.||
||288||106||Sandy the Seal||The tunnel is chock full of rhynocs and floating mines. The only way to retrieve that egg is to defeat every single rhynoc in the tunnel.||
||289||106||Snappy the Seal||Wow! I can't believe I survived that blast! It's a good thing I kept this egg nice and safe in my pocket.||
||290||098||Zoe||This is a superfly powerup Spyro. Whenever you walk through any powerup that looks like this one, it will allow you to fly for a while...||
||291||098||Zoe||Your game camera is currently in 'Passive' mode. This mode requires you to control the camera yourself, and moves more slowly.||
||292||170||Bianca||Hey, you finally made it, Spyro! Hunter was a little worried about you when you went off to fight the Sorceress, but I always knew you'd beat her.||
||293||124||Shui||Thank you for offering to help Spyro, but surely even you wouldn't be able to defeat all those rhynocs until the power up is active.||
||294||136||Errol||That rhynoc has been gloating ever since he beat you, but I think it was just a fluke. You should ask for a rematch!||
||295||110||XXX the Mountain Goat||Follow Bobby and Pete up there using your air-hop! It's easy, just press the < button again at the top of your jump.||
||296||100||Citizen Paulus||We showed those two bullies. If they hadn't outnumbered me two to one, I'd have finished them off ages ago.||
||297||106||Stanley the Seal||My plan worked! That dumb octopus dropped the jail key while he was shaking me! Now I can free my friends...||
||298||100||Hunter||Having trouble? If you use the < button to jump off the ramps you'll get extra height and distance.||
||299||120||Hunter||Well, there's no shame in losing to the master... at least not much shame... Wanna try again?||
||300||
||301||162||Hunter||YES!!! That was close! The egg popped out just before the saucer crash landed!||
||302||120||Ooga||My friend is feeling much better now... Oh, no! He's started his bone dance again...||
||303||116||Moneybags||Oh dear Spyro, you really should pay up. I think he's pining for the fjords.||
||304||116||Shiny||Just hop on, Spyro.\ The sky shall be your domain.\ New worlds await you!||
||305||118||Moneybags||I always knew you were a cultured sort of dragon. Well, step right in, the show's about to start.||
||306||116||Zoe||I wouldn't want to go back in there with all those creepy spiders...but if Sparx wants to check out Spider Town again, it's fine with me.||
||307||120||Pablo||My friend Jasper has a plan to blow the statue to kingdom come, but we'll have to clear out these rhynocs first.||
||308||146||Bartholomew||A stinkin' rhynoc has blocked the way with this box. It shouldn't be any problem for you to push it out of the way though.||
||309||116||Zoe||Hi Spyro and Sparx... I've found another lost egg! If Sparx is up to it, he can try to rescue it from Spider Town.||
||310||120||Ooga||Have you found any of my friend's bones? We have to go back to Skelos Badlands, and we can't leave without them.||
||311||118||Bob||This place is getting too dangerous. If Doug wants to go ice fishing, he'll have to haul his lazy butt down here!||
||312||100||Marco||Alas, I have lost my love, guarded by evil rhynocs at the top of yonder tower. Can you rescue her for me?||
||313||098||Mayor Leo||I don't know how this balloon works, but I think we can get it working for you if you bring back someone from each of the other worlds.||
||314||106||Zoe||If you want a quick summary of your progress in a world, you can press the @4SELECT@0 button to open the Atlas page for the world you are in.||
||315||136||Bartholomew||That dumb yeti took my ball. I told him to give it back or you'd kick his lousy butt, but he wouldn't listen.||
||316||158||Allgeier||Sorry, dragon, that's completely wrong. You can try again, but you'll never get it by merely guessing.||
||317||142||Jack||At last! I've found the legendary golden goose! You can have another one of its eggs for a souvenir!||
||318||104||Stoney||Are you the dragon looking for all those eggs? Because I saw a shifty looking character with one over there.||
||319||102||Stratus||We usually wake up our rain cloud at the crack of dawn, but these mischievous spirits are stopping our bells from ringing. &[Use the superfly powerup to flame the spirits in the belltowers.||
||320||120||Hunter||I'm thinking you're ready to try some one-on-one competition. Want to try a freestyle competition for points?||
||321||098||Zoe||If you like, I can change the game camera to 'Active' mode. In 'Active' mode, the camera moves much faster.||
||322||154||The Amazing Randini||The moles are still a little over excited and I can't start my next performance unitl they calm down, are you sure you can't help?||
||323||118||Moneybags||What? You don't want to pay? What are you saving your money for, another sequel?||
||324||122||Basho/Buson the Firefly||\           The eggs are all free!\          Two dragons are born today!\            Sheila's my hero.||
||325||122||Basho/Buson the Firefly||\           The eggs are all free!\          Two dragons are born today!\            Sheila's my hero.||
||326||140||Greta||It looks like the sorcewess has already used the plans to build her own wocket. We have to destwoy it. Just follow me.||
||327||098||Sheila||Hi, Spyro. If you bring someone back from each of the five worlds, we'll have enough weight to pull down this balloon for you.||
||328||098||Rocky||If you can bring back one person from each of our five worlds, we can help you use the balloon.||
||329||110||Sheila||Thanks again, Spyro! Now I have to find out what that nasty Sorceress has done to my home while I was locked up.||
||330||098||Zoe||OK, I won't change it. Remember, you can change the camera mode yourself by using the Options Menu.||
||331||158||Jamal||Very impressive! That is correct. Good luck in the demolition hovercraft competition.||
||332||116||Moneybags||Get away from me dragon, you've got no money! Come back when you find some gems...||
||333||124||Sing Sing||Oh! The emergency escape bridge! Why didn't I think of it sooner? I shall open it right away.||
||334||118||Bob||I was supposed to meet Doug to go ice fishing today... but rhynocs have blocked the path with ice, so I can't get through.||
||335||146||Bartholomew||If you use your spin move to deflect the snowball into the gong I bet we can make the roof cave in.||
||336||138||Hunter||Awww, shucks... I thought you'd want to race 'em. Well, just come talk to me if you change your mind.||
||337||134||Greta||Now that I've wescued the secwet plans we can finish building the wocket. If only I had a little more help.||
||338||138||Hunter||Awww, shucks... I thought you'd want to race 'em. Well, just come talk to me if you change your mind.||
||339||106||Smelt the Seal||I don't blame you. I already owe seven years of kitchen duty, and I'm not about to risk getting another month!||
||340||164||Professor||Try not to fall off the pedestal. I recommend using sniper mode to take out these targets.||
||341||122||Moneybags||\           I can't let you through.\       You're too poor to pass this door.\           Come back with more cash.||
||342||116||Hunter||When you see a ladder, or walls that look climbable, just jump onto it and you'll grab it with your claws.||
||343||116||Doug||If you can bring back one person from each of our five worlds, we can help you use the whirligig.||
||344||140||Handel||You can't afford to waste any time Spywo. If you leave the fire dwagons alone their tails will gwo back.||
||345||
||346||142||Eileen||Hurry, Spyro! If we don't get to the castle right away, the princess will be forced to marry that loser, Prince Azrael!||
||347||146||Bartholomew||We have to get the timing just right. Press the > button to spin your club when I throw a snowball.||
||348||152||Bianca||Good luck, Spyro... and watch out, she's very powerful and very sneaky.||
||349||100||Hunter||Yeah, maybe you'd better practice a bit first... Just come back here when you're up for a challenge.||
||350||102||Cumulus||If you can't keep up with the sun seed, remember you can always hold down the > button to charge.||
||351||098||Rocky||This balloon will take you to the great Tiki Lodge in the sky! Just jump on when you're ready.||
||352||104||Clay||Rhynocs are running rampant around here, but I can't get anyone out of the Tiki Lodge long enough to do anything about it.||
||353||134||Zoe||Princess Ami showed me a place called Starfish Reef. She says there's an egg hidden in there. I think Sparx should check it out.||
||354||136||Bartholomew||This time it will be a 3 round match, and when you win, don't let him send you off with a stupid egg!||
||355||124||Feng||I'm sure you have many important things to do, but if you could find the time to help please come back.||
||356||120||Jasper||Oooops, I forgot I hid this egg inside the statue. I hope the explosion didn't hard boil it...||
||357||120||Ooga||Here have this. I was going to keep it as a souvenir, but I don't have room in my luggage.||
||358||116||Shiny the Firefly||Follow me, Spyro.\ The whirligig awaits you.\ The sky shall be yours!||
||359||140||Handel||Thanks for wescuing me, you'd better look after this egg before the whynocs twy to blow that up too.||
||360||100||Sheila||This balloon will take you to a land closer to the Sorceress, Spyro. You can also use it to come back here whenever you want to.||
||361||098||Hunter||Hey that was great! And while you were boarding, I found this in a lizard burrow.||
||362||100||Rocky||At last, my portal is working again! Come visit me at the Tiki Lodge!||
||363||122||Moneybags||Stop talking to me.\         I hate speaking in Haiku.\           Just go find some gems...||
||364||122||Sheila||This swamp smells so sweet.\        The springtime trees are fragrant.\            I'm off to kick butt.||
||365||104||Clay||Well, it looks like it's just you and me. I'll keep a look out while you sort out the rhynocs.||
||366||106||Sigmund the Seal||I can't wait until the rhynocs build a new submarine! Next time it's my turn to drive!||
||367||102||Moneybags||Heh heh... I haven't made such easy money since the Sorceress bought that mayonaisse for sunscreen.||
||368||100||Zoe||That means your progress is saved. If you get into trouble you'll return to the last place you got zapped.||
||369||100||Sheila||Hey Spyro, there are rhynocs everywhere. Maybe I can find some peace and quiet at the top of the tower...||
||370||138||Hunter||You might be able to beat me at skateboarding, but I still get all the chicks.||
||371||100||Hunter||Whoa, that was sweet! And look, there was another egg in the lizard burrow.||
||372||160||Sheriff Wyatt||Jumpin' jehosephat, that's the cutest lookin' dinosaur I ever did see.||
||373||152||Zoe||That's it Sparx, you've found all the lost eggs, but you can still go back to the Bugbot Factory if you like.||
||374||170||Hunter||I think my tongue is frozen. You'd better not lose again!||
||375||124||Bartholomew||We sure made short work of those rhynocs! Aren't you glad I was here to help you rescue that baby dragon?||
||376||122||Homer the Firefly||No happier sight \ Have I seen, than a tea lamp \ lit by Dragonflame.||
||377||136||Eustace||Brrr, I don't know why but I feel reaaalllly cold.||
||378||138||Crazy Ed||'Nother dad burned ship in the way o' me treasure... Wouldja mind blastin' this one too?||
||379||134||Princess Ami||Hop on, Spyro! Don't worry, fairy engineering has never failed.||
||380||106||Sebastian the Seal||The rhynocs have boarded up a lot of our doors, but I bet you're strong enough to smash them down.||
||381||100||Mayor Leo||Thank you for rescuing my town. As mayor I award you with one of our famous giant chicken eggs.||
||382||114||Zoe||Looks like you're ready Sparx. If you need any more help, just choose the HELP option from the Pause Menu.||
||383||164||Professor||Now I can switch the gravitonometric generator back on. I hope no birds got in there...||
||384||164||Professor||Thank you very much for saving my laboratory. Now I can resume thinking...||
||385||146||Bentley||Well I'd love to leave with you but I still have to look after Bartholomew.||
||386||110||Zoe||If you ever forget how to control a character or vehicle, just go to the Pause Menu and select 'Help'.||
||387||146||Bentley||Ah well, I must return to my humble abode, for the time being.||
||388||106||Zoe||You can Hover to get more distance when gliding. Just press the } button at the end of your glide.||
||389||122||Basho/Buson the Firefly|| \ Yes! It's bombing time! \ Here I come, my little eggs, \ To free you at last!!||
||390||124||Bartholomew||Heh, heh, that looked like it hurt. You should try using your spin move to deflect those barrels.||
||391||124||Ling Ling||If you could clear the way for Chi Chi and Li they'd most likely be able to push that boulder out of your way.||
||392||130||Sgt.Byrd||If you charge into the lava boulders after I drop them, they'll explode against anything they hit.||
||393||122||Homer the Firefly||Our tea lamps are dark. \ Perhaps your hot dragon breath \ could set them aglow.||
||394||122||Basho/Buson the Firefly|| \ Yes! It's bombing time! \ Here I come, my little eggs, \ To free you at last!!||
||395||122||Basho/Buson the Firefly|| \ Yes! It's bombing time! \ Here I come, my little eggs, \ To free you at last!!||
||396||???||Sparx|| ||
||397||134||Moneybags||Very well then, I was having a rather good time poking him with a stick, anyway.||
||398||138||Hunter||So, are you ready to race these guys? They bet us an egg that you won't win!||
||399||106||Shappy the Seal||Owww... That really smarts... No problem though, we've got more bombs!!!||
||400||136||Bartholomew||Oh... I found my ball, I'd forgotten I lent it to Eugene yesterday. No harm done, right?||
||401||142||Molly||I just saw Prince Azrael run into the castle! We have to stop him before he reaches the princess!||
||402||098||Zoe||The game camera is now in 'Passive' mode. If you want me to change it again, just ask!||
||403||098||Zoe||Sparx has already recovered the egg from the crawdad farm, but he can go back if he wants to practice.||
||404||156||Hunter||Try not to get hit by the exploding ammo, OK? I don't want to scare off my new pet.||
||405||154||The Astounding Arturo||Did you tell the Great Zamboni? That charlatan has been stealing my tricks again.||
||406||154||The Amazing Randini||A light tap on the head should sort them out, but watch out for my friends, they're trying to burrow after them.||
||407||154||The Amazing Randini||Well that didn't do it. See they've got themselves all worked up into a tizzy. You'll have to try again.||
||408||122||Bubba the Firefly||He swore to destroy\ whoever lights the tea lamps.\ Better you than me.||
||409||146||Bartholomew||Hey bro! It'd be really cool if you smashed that boulder. A swift smack should do the trick.||
||410||146||Bartholomew||Another gong, great. I bet we can cause an avalanche with this one!||
||411||146||Bartholomew||It took me forever to train those seals to throw snowballs. Now they've gone and turned on me!||
||412||104||Moneybags||Thank you, Spyro, and best of luck catching those dastardly egg thieves.||
||413||106||Sal the Seal||Driving that submarine was a blast! Next time we're going to borrow the rhynocs' speed boat!||
||414||102||Cirrus||If my wings were big and strong like yours, I could easily glide across here.||
||415||???||Sparx|| ||
||416||120||Hunter||Just jump at the top of any blue ramp and steer left or right in the air to spin!||
||417||110||Sheila||I'd better go check on those billy goats again. Last time I left them alone, they ate all the shingles off the roof.||
||418||110||Sheila||Whew, that was fun! I tell you, Spyro, kicking rhynoc butt just never gets old!||
||419||136||Bartholomew||Hey!!! This isn't my ball, it's just another stupid egg!||
||420||164||Agent 9||I'll be back when I've wiped out the last of the rhynoc menace!||
||421||154||The Great Zamboni||Hey, I finally seem to have got the hang of this, those crystals have stayed up for ages.||
||422||156||Tara||I'll be going now. After all, a girl of my abundant talents has to keep herself busy.||
||423||154||The Amazing Randini||I don't think you should be wasting time talking to me, those moles are still going crazy.||
||424||122||Homer the Firefly||Beware the water.\ Snapping jaws of piranha\ claim many victims.||
||425||122||Bubba the Firefly||A creepy wizard\ lives inside, but hates the light.\ He has awoken.||
||426||124||Shui||Please, hop aboard. Make sure to toast the rhynocs, but not my friends!||
||427||122||Basho/Buson the Firefly||If you clear my path\ I can blow up the egg cage.\ Poor, poor captive eggs.||
||428||122||Basho/Buson the Firefly||If you clear my path\ I can blow up the egg cage.\ Poor, poor captive eggs.||
||429||122||Homer the Firefly||That gator was mean.\ I thought I was a goner.\ Thanks for saving me.||
||430||110||Bobby(?) the Mountain Goat||You remember how to stomp, doncha? Just jump, then press the } button in the air.||
||431||154||The Fantastic Frederico||I'm working on a new trick now, but I've left the whirlwind going in case you need to use it.||
||432||128||Cpl. Gabrielle||Sir! I've captured the enemy rations. They won't march far on an empty stomach.||
||433||122||Bubba the Firefly||The tea lamps are lit!\  Now I'll tell you the secret\ of what's in this house!||
||434||124||Sing Sing||We would be honored if you would accept this as a token of our appreciation.||
||435||124||Feng||Do you mind? I'm trying to avoid being trampled by a water buffalo.||
||436||???||Sparx|| ||
||437||138||Crazy Ed||Wouldja lookit that! Some fool hid a dang gum egg in me treasure.||
||438||140||Handel||Thanks for helping me Agent 9. Those whynocs never knew what hit them.||
||439||136||Errol||You gave that rhynoc such a drubbing he's retired from the sport for good.||
||440||100||Hunter||This is the most fun I've had since we chased King Flippy on the manta ray.||
||441||160||Deputy Holiday||It's mighty dangerous down there. You oughta watch out you don't get hurt.||
||442||130||Sgt. Byrd||Whenever you get low on health, just toast a chicken or two, and you'll soon be ship shape.||
||443||118||Doug||Oh, by the way, feel free to use our gondola whenever you want.||
||444||120||Hunter||No problem, check the place out for yourself. Just meet me back here later!||
||445||122||Bubba the Firefly||When all lamps are lit\ there is a secret in here\ that I will show you.||
||446||124||Lei, Feng, и прочие||If only there were three of us I'm sure we could reach that switch to open the drawbridge.||
||447||124||Chi Chi или Feng||Wahey! Ahem, sorry the excitement got the better of me.||
||448||124||Chi Chi или Feng||Wahey! Ahem, sorry the excitement got the better of me.||
||449||124||Lei, Feng, Chi Chi||If only there were three of us I'm sure we could reach that switch to open the drawbridge.||
||450||100||Rapunzel||What! Marco sent you here? I've got a restraining order against him.||
||451||104||Rocky||Here, take this egg. They were giving them away at the Tiki Lodge last night.||
||452||102||Fluffy||Oh, you activated the bellows? Maybe I can get the cloud generator working again...||
||453||098||Shappy the Seal||Yay, my portal is working! I'll see you at the beach!||
||454||146||Bentley||I'm afraid I still have to attend to the safety of young Bartholomew.||
||455||136||Bartholomew||You should go back and kick his butt again! Make him give me my ball back.||
||456||138||Hunter||Woooohooo! I'm still the speed king of the world!||
||457||138||Hunter||Alright! Eat my skate-dust, sucker!||
||458||Sparx||
||459||162||Hunter||WHAT? You're kidding! We gotta hurry, he's getting away!||
||460||154||The Amazing Randini||Well I hope the moles calm down soon, I've created a fantastic new trick I want to show them.||
||461||124||Chi Chi||If you could rescue Li we'd be able to push this boulder out of the way.||
||462||124||Lei||Oh no, I think that water buffalo is going to trample me.||
||463||124||Bartholomew||Hey, I think I saw some rhynocs run up to the top of that hill with an egg!||
||464||134||Greta||The wocket is weady for waunch, Spywo. Hop aboard whenever you want.||
||465||134||Eugene||Why don't you ask around the other worlds to see if you can get me some help to build this rocket.||
||466||
||467||110||XXX the Mountain Goat||Thanks for the help, Sheila! You can have this egg I found in my house.||
||468||100||Councillor George||Those pesky rhynocs are back again, but I'm sure you'll soon sort them out.||
||469||102||Nimbus||You'd think the Sorceress would want more rain, after what the sun has done to her skin.||
||470||120||Hunter||Alright! Whoever scores the most points in the time limit, wins!||
||471||
||472||136||Errol||Great, freeze the cats and push them into my goal to score.||
||473||136||Eustace||It would be easy to get up to that treasure if you had something to stand on.||
||474||Sparx||
||475||Sparx||
||476||108||Hunter||Looks like I'll have to hop in my plane and teach 'em some manners!||
||477||100||Mayor Leo||I'm sorry, that was the ugliest chicken I've ever seen.||
||478||098||Hunter||To get the best glide, press the < button at the very top of your jump.||
||479||102||Fluffy||The rhynocs must have been using this thing to clog up the cloud generator.||
||480||106||Snappy the Seal||No problem. We'll be playing hot potato with this bomb until you come back.||
||481||104||Sgt. Byrd||Hello Spyro, I'm just off to the Tiki Lodge for some R and R.||
||482||138||Hunter||So, are you ready to take my challenge?||
||483||118||Bob||Ohhh... you shot the ice block, eh? Must be beginner's luck.||
||484||118||Nancy||That's OK, it didn't hurt as much as it looked. Let's try again!||
||485||124||Ling Ling||Thank you ever so much for opening the emergency bridge, Spyro.||
||486||128||Pvt. Eloise||Request permission to cheer, sir... Hip Hip Hooray!||
||487||126||Hunter||I'm gonna strap on my jetpack and blast some space cows!||
||488||128||Pvt. Eloise||Request permission to cheer, sir... Hip Hip Hooray!||
||489||116||Sing Sing||We've finished repairing the whirligig, but we need more help to operate it.||
||490||116||Sgt. Byrd||I've assessed the situation. We need five men to operate the whirligig.||
||491||118||Moneybags||I have to hurry in myself. I'm one of the judges for tonight's performance.||
||492||116||Sgt. Byrd||Thanks for freeing me. Why don't you come visit me in my home world?||
||493||142||Jack||You've been doing great so far, why don't you take two more seeds?||
||494||108||Hunter||Yeah, when sheep go hi-tech, you gotta watch out!||
||495||100||Citizen Horace||Look, a chicken turned up. I hope it's not the only one left.||
||496||112||Sheila||If you can charge toad boy into the lava, I think I can finish him off.||
||497||100||Citizen Horace||Thanks for the help, but I think I would have worn him down in a minute.||
||498||098||Hunter||Oh, I almost forgot, I found this egg!||
||499||120||Hunter||Just come find me when you're ready for a good thrashing!||
||500||164||Professor||Just a few more enemies left! You can do it!||
||501||146||Bartholomew||Thanks bro! Here's a little something for your rock collection.||
||502||160||Deputy Holiday||That was some mighty fine swimmin', young dragon.||
||503||170||Bianca||I hope the rest of the dragons will come back here someday.||
||504||128||Pvt. XXX||Before I was captured, I recovered this egg from the enemy, sir!||
||505||128||Pvt. XXX||Before I was captured, I recovered this egg from the enemy, sir!||
||506||118||Nancy||Maybe you can be my ice dancing partner in the next Olympics!||
||507||124||Shui||Please take this shiny egg, it will bring you good luck.||
||508||136||Alex||When I get my flippers on that rotten bear...||
||509||136||Ernest||I knew we should have bought the automated laser defense system.||
||510||136||Alex||Maybe you could use the laser to melt that ice block as well.||
||511||110||XXX the Mountain Goat||Don't worry, I'll just keep kicking this rock until it breaks.||
||512||128||Sgt. Byrd||Don't worry I'll have the hummingbirds whipped into shape in no time.||
||513||128||Cpl. Gabrielle||Mission accomplished. It's great to have you back, sir.||
||514||
||515||Sparx||
||516||106||Snappy the Seal||Yippee! I'll light the fuse on the next bomb!||
||517||104||Stoney||You should catch that thief before he steals something valuable.||
||518||100||Councillor George||Are you a dragon? I never believed you really existed.||
||519||
||520||156||Hunter||Right on, go get 'em!||
||521||160||Deputy Roy||That darn Bailey gang!||
||522||170||Hunter||Sure, come back whenever you want to ride it!||
||523||124||Shui||I'm sure you would succeed if you were to try again.||
||524||100||Councillor George||Would you like a chicken sandwich? They're very good.||
||525||102||Stratus||Do you want this doodad? It fell out of the belfry.||
||526||164||Agent 9||I still haven't finished clearing the rhynocs off the island...||
||527||170||Hunter||OK, good luck this time.||
||528||140||Handel||I knew those monsters would be no match for you.||
||529||138||Crazy Ed||Darn tootin'! Git on little dragon!||
||530||098||Cumulus||Hop in the balloon whenever you want, Spyro!||
||531||100||Citizen Horace||Whoo I'm dizzy.||
||532||110||Sheila||I'll be back as soon as I get all three billy goats home.||
||533||110||Sheila||Goodbye, Spyro, I'm sure I'll see you around!||
||534||100||Hunter||Go get 'em, Spyro!||
||535||100||Hunter||Well whenever you're ready, come and talk to me.||
||536||124||Feng/Tsai/Chi Chi/Lei||Please would you be so kind as to step aside.||
||537||124||Feng/Tsai/Chi Chi/Lei||Please would you be so kind as to step aside.||
||538||124||Chi Chi||Help, help!||
||539||138||Hunter||Alright! Let 'em have it!||
||540||100||Rapunzel||If you see Marco please tell him I've moved out.||
||541||110||Sheila||I still haven't finished getting all the billy goats home yet...||
||542||146||Bartholomew||This is the last round, finish him off.||
||543||146||Bartholomew||Hey you're in the way. Move it!||
||544||Sparx||
||545||116||Sing Sing||Let's head on over to the whirligig.||
||546||142||Jack||OK, here are your seeds again.||
||547||142||Jack||OK, here are your seeds again.||
||548||138||Crazy Ed||Well, come back whenevers y' like.||
||549||108||Hunter||Look out sheep, here I come!||
||550||106||Snappy the Seal||Ready to try stomping the turrets again?||
||551||098||Rocky||Let's head on over to the balloon.||
||552||098||Cumulus||Let's head on over to the balloon!||
||553||Sparx||
||554||128||Sgt. Byrd||Any time you wanna leave just say so.||
||555||170||Hunter||Great! Hop aboard!||
||556||124||Lei||Just let me catch my breath.||
||557||120||Sgt. Byrd||I'll be here when you need me.||
||558||120||Sgt. Byrd||It's good to be back in action.||
||559||Sparx||
||560||104||Stoney||Those guys ought to be locked up.||
||561||098||Snappy the Seal||Let's head on over to the balloon!||
||562||124||Ling Ling||Doobedoobedoo.||
||563||
||564||118||Nancy||Thanks! Let's go!||
||565||118||Nancy||Do you want to try again?||
||566||098||Sheila||Let's head on over to the balloon!||
||567||106||Slappy the Seal||Stay and get a tan, if you like.||
||568||128||Pvt. Helene||What are your orders, sir?||
||569||128||Pvt. Helene||What are your orders, sir?||
||570||124||Tsai||Help!!||
||571||128||Pvt. Helene||What are your orders, sir?||
||572||128||Cpl. Gabrielle||Awaiting orders, sir.||
||573||156||Hunter||Have fun!||

||1001||136||Alex||Some bear sold us a laser defense system to protect us from Rhynocs, but with these flippers I can't even turn it on. You'd have no trouble using it though. Just walk inside. When you're done, press the } button and you'll walk back out.||
||1002||154||Bentley||Good evening Spyro. The Amazing Randini is about to put on a display of prestidigitation. I've heard that it's quite impressive so I'm going to watch the show.||
||1003||158||Allgeier||Hmmmm... have you heard that one before? I never thought you'd get it. Very well, a bargain is a bargain. You may have the dragon egg that I was guarding from the Sorceress.||
||1004||106||Sandy the Seal||We had a dragon egg for you, but we used it to test our ultra-high-speed-super-fluidity tunnel. The good news is that it made it to the end of the tunnel without a scratch! The bad news is that there's no way to get it back out now.||
||1005||160||Sheriff Wyatt||Well I'll be, so that's how my prisoners keep escaping! Here take this dinosaur egg away before it hatches and causes more trouble. I think it must have been the runt of the litter though.||
||1006||156||Hunter||OK. By the way, if you see Bianca around, can you tell her to meet me here? I... uh... promised I'd give her scuba lessons once the sharks were gone.||
||1007||156||Hunter||I've been training my new pet manta ray to carry the latest technology super-high-impact underwater missile launchers! Wanna ride him, and try blastin' some sharks? &Ride manta ray and shoot sharks?||
||1008||120||Pablo||Those crummy rhynocs forced us to build a statue of the Sorceress. Then, after we built it, she complained it was too ugly! If you ask me, the statue is much prettier than she is.||
||1009||142||Moneybags||You have chosen wisely, Spyro. I'll tell the wizards to raise the steps immediately... And, err, best of luck rescuing that princess, or whatever it is you're up to...||
||1010||120||Hunter||Alright, you nailed it. Now let's see if you can do a 900! Get as much height as you can, spin two and a half revolutions in the air and land back on the ramp.||
||1011||152||Moneybags||Heh heh, you've always had a weakness for helping silly little creatures, haven't you, Spyro? Ah well, I suppose there couldn't be any harm in letting him out, could there?||
||1012||Sparx||
||1013||098||Rocky||I'm late for a dinner party at the Tiki Lodge, and the portal to my home just stopped working. Maybe the portal will reactivate after a few more dragons hatch.||
||1014||098||Hunter||I saw something shiny in that cave over there...let's go check it out! You can get there by hovering. To hover, just press the } button at the end of your glide!||
||1015||154||The Great Zamboni||You want to see the trick again? Well, alright but I want you to know this isn't as easy as it looks... ALAKAZAM!||
||1016||154||The Fantastic Frederico||Ok, I'll show you again. If you watch carefully maybe you'll be able to see how it's done... ABRACADABRA!||
||1017||158||Allgeier||I see you've managed to survive the trials of the catacombs. Now let's find out if your wits are as quick as your feet. Do you remember the riddle?||
||1018||154||The Fantastic Frederico||All this magic is just misdirection you know. Which is why I'm going to start that whirlwind over there... ABRACADABRA!||
||1019||156||Moneybags||OK, there was no password. I was standing in front of the wall switch. What are you going to do, sue me?||
||1020||140||Agent 9||Hey Spyro, I'm helping a kid called Handel recover some secret rocket plans the Sorceress stole. You know I'm always ready to kick some rhynoc booty.||
||1021||Sparx||
||1022||102||Moneybags||What? NO? What else are you going to do with all those gems? Buy flying lessons? (Heh heh) that was a good one...||
||1023||102||Cumulus||Our sun has gone out. We can make a new one with our lava fusion cauldron and three sun seeds, but they keep burning out before we can get them in the pot.||
||1024||170||Bianca||Oh, by the way, Hunter is around here somewhere. He's been tinkering with one of his new toys all day, and he wants to show it off. You should go see him!||
||1025||120||Hunter||Let's start with something easy. You can jump off the end of ramps by pressing the < button. I'll show you how to do it once, then it's your turn.||
||1026||120||Ooga||What did you have to come back for? Now he's going to do his whole routine again! Well, here we go...||
||1027||120||Hunter||Just press the < button at the top of the ramp to jump off it. Try jumping as close to the top as possible to get the most hang time.||
||1028||152||Zoe||Once you complete Sparx's special tasks in Sunrise Spring Home and Midday Garden Home, he will gain new abilities that will make collecting gems much easier!||
||1029||110||Billy the Mountain Goat||You see that rhynoc guy up ahead? He's still mad at us for hanging his underpants on top of this tree. We'll just wait over here while you give him a swift kick.||
||1030||098||Snappy the Seal||I want to repay you for saving me from that octopus. We can help you use this hot air balloon, if you just bring back someone from each of the other worlds.||
||1031||100||Hunter||Caught all the lizards yet? If you're having trouble catching them, don't be afraid to use your flame breath while on the skateboard.||
||1032||136||Bartholomew||I knew you'd do it. Go and show him not to mess with us. Remember to block his high punches, and hit him low when he tries to block.||
||1033||146||Bartholomew||Hey brainiac, you're supposed to be smart. Why don't you try pushing those blocks around to bridge that gap?||
||1034||164||Agent 9||Hiya, Spyro... I'm just off to patrol the island again, you know, in case any rhynocs decided to come crawling back...||
||1035||124||Bentley||Ah, a fine day for a bit of a walk. I was just heading to the top of my favorite hill...||
||1036||110||Billy the Mountain Goat||I think my taunting is wearing them down! Remember, just jump and press the triangle button to stomp those huts.||
||1037||164||Professor||By my calculations, the bombs in this handy vending machine should be highly effective against armor. Give it a shot. &[Press the > button to throw bombs.||
||1038||146||Bentley||I'm afraid my home is still infested with rhynocs, I'll return when they are dealt with.||
||1039||138||Hunter||Heh heh, what's the matter, getting chicken on me? Bwaaak bwaaak bwaaaaaak! Bwak bwaak bwak bwak bwaaaaaaaaaak!||
||1040||138||Hunter||Heh heh, you're just chicken aren't you? Bwaaak bwaaak bwaaaaaak! Bwak bwaak bwak bwak bwaaaaaaaaaak!||
||1041||118||Bob||You can hop on the cannon and try shooting the ice block if you want to, but I'm warning you, it's a lot harder than it looks!||
||1042||Sparx||
||1043||136||Moneybags||Heh heh... I hate to spoil the game for you, Spyro, but I've already bribed the local team to forfeit to the rhynocs.||
||1044||098||Mayor Leo||I guess you just hop in the balloon, now... Don't ask me how it works, I just showed up for the punch and cookies, a ha ha ha.||
||1045||158||Dan||Don't try to answer the riddle now. You'll need to save your breath to survive the trials of the catacombs.||
||1046||118||Bob||I've been trying to clear the way with this cannon, but it doesn't even shoot straight. I haven't been able to hit a dang thing all morning.||
||1047||116||Shiny||You need five people\ To help with the whirligig.\ Find one in each world.||
||1048||Sparx||
||1049||146||Bartholomew||C'mon, c'mon just press the { button to swing your club. I wanna see it break into a million pieces.||
||1050||142||Jack||According to legends, there's a golden goose at the top of this here mountain. I want to be the first person to the top, so I can grab it!||
||1051||136||Ernest||What if you tried melting the snowman using the laser? I'd do it myself, but you know, the flippers.||
||1052||108||Hunter||Whoooa! A bunch of sheep in flying saucers just came out of nowhere and started blasting up the race course!||
||1053||100||Councillor George||Oh my! Oh my! Can you help us? Hordes of ferocious rhynocs have overrun our town and kidnapped the mayor.||
||1054||104||Stoney||Hey, there goes another one. He was really fast...maybe if I activate the supercharge you'll be able to catch him.||
||1055||106||Stu the Seal||We never would have crashed that submarine if Sal hadn't tried that hand-brake u-turn during an inverted barrel roll.||
||1056||104||Moneybags||I guess those egg thieves are going to get what's coming to them... it's too bad... I always sort of liked those guys.||
||1057||136||Bartholomew||You lost! Oh, some brother you are. I'm never going to see my ball again, am I?||
||1058||136||Bartholomew||You lost? But how am I going to get my ball back? You've got to try again.||
||1059||160||Deputy Roy||Back again? Well, the Bailey gang is still hidin' out. Ya' ready to take 'em on? ||
||1060||122||Homer the Firefly||\           You are brave, dragon.\         Much braver than I, by far.\          Here, take this darn egg.||
||1061||140||Greta||Hey, look what was in the wocket. They must have been twying to put it into orbit.||
||1062||134||Zoe||Sparx has already found the lost egg in Starfish Reef, but if he wants to go back for a swim, I can lead the way.||
||1063||166||Agent 9||Woohoo! Time to kick some Sorceress butt!||
||1064||154||The Amazing Randini||I'm afraid I've had to cancel my next performance. One of the moles ate all my magic cards.||
||1065||Sparx||
||1066||124||Chi Chi/Feng||Pushing that boulder was hard work, but as soon as I've caught my breath I'll return to collecting bamboo.||
||1067||124||Chi Chi/Feng||Pushing that boulder was hard work, but as soon as I've caught my breath I'll return to collecting bamboo.||
||1068||122||Moneybags||\           Dad gummit, dragon.\      Just cough up those stinking gems.\           And I can go home.||
||1069||120||Ooga||You're doing great, please find the rest of the bones so we can put my friend back together.||
||1070||124||Feng||We would gladly pull the switch to open the drawbridge, if only there weren't all these nasty creatures chasing us.||
||1071||122||Moneybags||\           This door is jammed shut.\            Only the power of gems\             Can hope to move it. ||
||1072||136||Bartholomew||heh heh heh... You really showed him... Hey, wait a minute this isn't my ball!||
||1073||110||Billy the Mountain Goat||Ahh, home at last! Here, I was saving this to make an omelet, but I think you deserve it more.||
||1074||154||The Magnificent Marvello||Here, you can have this. I was going to use it in a trick, but my magic just keeps bouncing off.||
||1075||154||Moneybags||I'm afraid the show's over, Spyro. Why don't you go play with the gnomes? I think they look lonely.||
||1076||170||Hunter||Right on! Just don't lose, or my tongue's gonna be a popsicle.||
||1077||170||Hunter||I just finished fixing up an old submarine! Why don't you try taking it for a spin?||
||1078||122||Buson the Firefly||\           Yes! It's bombing time!\          Here I come, my little eggs,\            to free you at last!! ||
||1079||152||Agent 9||Thanks for freeing me. Why don't you come visit me in my home world.||
||1080||138||Crazy Ed||I reckon me treasure be thisaway... But we'll hafta blast through this bloomin' ship tuh git to it!||
||1081||140||Greta||If you see Handel tell him I've gone back to Evening Lake to finish work on the pwofessor's wocket.||
||1082||154||The Amazing Randini||Well done, and look, one of my friends dug up this whilst chasing the moles.||
||1083||164||Professor||You'll need to take out all the rhynocs to secure the beach... and don't forget to dodge!||
||1084||170||Hunter||Yeah, let's wait for my tongue to thaw first.||
||1085||128||Cpl. Gabrielle||Recommend you take the enemy out with your rockets by pressing the { button, sir!||
||1086||122||Basho the Firefly||\           One egg cage remains.\        Will you now help my brother\           to free the last egg?||
||1087||122||Basho the Firefly||\           One egg cage remains.\        Will you now help my brother\           to free the last egg?||
||1088||146||Bartholomew||I heard those big bullies calling you a wuss. You're not going to let them get away with that are you?||
||1089||142||Jack||By the way, if you can't figure out what to do next, we can always start over.||
||1090||142||Alicia||There's no time to lose! Prince Azrael and his cat armies are about to steal our poor princess!||
||1091||128||Cpl. Gabrielle||Sir! We need to rescue the rest of the squad before we can launch a raid on the Sorceress's castle.||
||1092||144||Hunter||I don't know, Spyro, I've never seen a sheep UFO this mad before...||
||1093||136||Errol||You should ask for a rematch. I think that guy sprayed catnip in his goal.||
||1094||100||Citizen Horace||Have you seen any of our giant chickens? The rhynocs have been trying to eat them all.||
||1095||104||Shale||Take this egg as a sign of your honorary membership in the lodge.||
||1096||102||Cumulus||Step on the switch to get a fresh sun seed and keep flaming it until you get it into the pot.||
||1097||102||Nimbus||The rhynocs have shut down our cloud generator and I'll never see a rainbow again.||
||1098||110||Billy the Mountain Goat||This next guy is a wuss! You go ahead and take him out, we'll get your back!||
||1099||100||Zoe||This rhynoc is too big to charge. You'll have to flame him using the { button.||
||1100||128||Sgt. Byrd||I have to train the hummingbirds. They must be in peak physical condition if we're going to take on the Sorceress.||
||1101||108||Hunter||Wooohooooo! Check it out, the squad leader had abducted this egg!||
||1102||104||Shale||Well that's never happened before. I hope it's not a bad omen.||
||1103||098||Zoe||Do you like the 'Active' camera mode? If not, I can set it back to the 'Passive' mode.||
||1104||124||Lei||If only there were three of us I'm sure we could reach that switch to open the drawbridge.||
||1105||122||Buson the Firefly||\           We will be waiting.\        When you return to help us.\           We shall bomb again!||
||1106||122||Buson the Firefly||\           We will be waiting.\        When you return to help us.\           We shall bomb again!||
||1107||120||Jasper||Not too bad, eh? Very post-neolithic, wouldn't you say?||
||1108||136||Errol||But if I can't find anyone to play for me I'll forfeit the championship.||
||1109||140||Handel||Here have this. I fished it out of the molten wava.||
||1110||136||Errol||Well done, I think you deserve to keep the champion's cup.||
||1111||106||Sandy the Seal||You'll have to defeat every single rhynoc in the tunnel before you can recapture the egg.||
||1112||106||Stanley the Seal||Oh, I forgot to tell you... one of the rhynocs had this egg in his lunch box...||
||1113||138||Hunter||Alright! Eat my skate-dust, sucker!||
||1114||128||Cpl. Gabrielle||Keep fighting the good fight sir! We're almost there, and I'm, uh, right behind you...||
||1115||124||Tsai||I'll be with you momentarily, I just need to rest for a second.||
||1116||124||Feng||If you could rescue Chi Chi we'd be able to push this boulder out of the way.||
||1117||128||Cpl. Gabrielle||One carefully placed rocket blast should take this door down, sir.||
||1118||116||Hunter||When you've picked up a rock, try using the } button to aim.||
||1119||116||Jasper||With guys from the five worlds we can work the whirligig.||
||1120||120||Sgt. Byrd||I'm ready to patrol the towers and the perimeter of the islands whenever you want me to.||
||1121||126||Hunter||We got the last one just before he abducted this egg!||
||1122||136||Errol||Don't waste time talking to me, he's gonna score.||
||1123||144||Hunter||You wait here, I'll lure the UFO down the river of honey!||
||1124||100||Hunter||If you want to try to catch those lizards, I'll start the clock now.||
||1125||100||Hunter||Awww, too bad... maybe you'll do better this time.||
||1126||154||The Astounding Arturo||I've been working on a great new magic trick, but this bear keeps spoiling it.||
||1127||158||Jamal||Very well, then. I will reserve your spot in case you change your mind.||
||1128||128||Pvt. Eloise||Request permission to cheer, sir... Hip Hip Hooray!||
||1129||138||Crazy Ed||Ah, dad gum, I gis I'll hafta git it workin' muhself.||
||1130||106||Smelt the Seal||OK, good luck! Just remember, stay away from the sharp end!||
||1131||146||Bentley||It's good to know that Bartholomew is out of harm's way.||
||1132||100||Zoe||Hi Spyro! Each time a fairy zaps you, like this...||
||1133||156||Hunter||You can ride the manta ray around just for fun, if you like.||
||1134||116|||Doug||The whirligig is ready to take you far way. Just jump aboard.||
||1135||124||Shui||Would you like to try some of this bamboo, it tastes great.||
||1136||124||Sing Sing||Would you care for a cup of my medicinal herbal tea?||
||1137||120||Hunter||Are you ready to learn some tricks and take on the next challenge?||
||1138||128||Pvt. XXX||Before I was captured, I recovered this egg from the enemy, sir!||
||1139||128||Pvt. XXX||Before I was captured, I recovered this egg from the enemy, sir!||
||1140||128||Pvt. XXX||Before I was captured, I recovered this egg from the enemy, sir!||
||1141||098||Sheila||Thanks for freeing me. Why don't you come visit me in my home world?||
||1142||110||Sheila||Well, I'm off to clean up the mess those rhynocs left behind.||
||1143||136||Bartholomew||Only two more rounds to go, you're doing great.||
||1144||128||Sgt. Byrd||Don't worry I'll have the hummingbirds whipped into shape in no time.||
||1145||170||Hunter||Aw, c'mon, you can take these guys!||
||1146||138||Crazy Ed||Okey Dokey, take good care of 'er, y' here?||
||1147||116||Jasper||Hey now, let's head on over to the whirligig.||
||1148||124||Lei||Please be careful those rockets are dangerous!||
||1149||138||Crazy Ed||Ya kin ride the sub just for fun, if ya like. &Ride the sub for cheap thrills?||
||1150||142||Jack||If you get stuck, we can always restart this section.||
||1151||
||1152||140||Handel||Watch out for that wava, it looks super hot.||
||1153||100||Citizen Paulus||Let me catch my breath and I'll kick that other guy's butt.||
||1154||120||Hunter||I think you're getting it, just try one more time.||
||1155||128||Sgt. Byrd||Tally ho, Spyro, I'm sure I'll see you around!||
||1156||154||The Marvelous Magnifico||I really think I'm beginning to get the hang of this magic malarkey.||
||1157||126||Hunter||Look out cows, here I come!||
||1158||116||Sing Sing||You can use the whirligig whenever you are ready.||
||1159||116||Sgt. Byrd||All systems checked out A-OK. Jump aboard.||
||1160||134||Eugene||The rocket's fueled up and ready to go Spyro.||
||1161||098||Snappy the Seal||The balloon's all ready, sir! Just jump on!||
||1162||170||Hunter||So, ready to race?||
||1163||124||Feng/Tsai/Chi Chi/Lei||Please would you be so kind as to step aside.||
||1164||124||Feng/Tsai/Chi Chi/Lei||Please would you be so kind as to step aside.||
||1165||170||Hunter||Wanna take my sub for a spin?||
||1166||124||Feng/Tsai/Chi Chi/Lei||Please would you be so kind as to step aside.||
||1167||116||Sgt. Byrd||Quick march Spyro. We're off to the whirligig.||
||1168||142||Jack||Well, good luck. It's got me stumped.||
||1169||144||Hunter||OK, here I go!||
||1170||100||Citizen Paulus||Have you seen any giant chickens around here?||
||1171||106||Smelt the Seal||Whaddya say, do you want to take on Bluto?||

||1175||138||Crazy Ed||Well, come back whenevers y' like.||
||1176||164||Agent 9||I'm just going to patrol the island one last time...||
||1177||162||Hunter||I'm gonna chase him down!||
||1178||116||Doug||Let's head on over to the whirligig.||
||1179||106||Sandy the Seal||Our beach is your beach.||
