||  37||098<br />30.29s||Bianca||So... you're the one in charge of rescuing the eggs, huh? Heh heh heh... How sad... Look here, dragon, if you know what's good for you, you'll turn around and crawl back up that hole you came through. Those eggs belong to us now, and I've hidden them in places you'll never find in a thousand years! Besides, even if you could find an egg, our expertly trained armies will dispose of you and take it back. Do I make myself clear? If I find you here again, I am going to be verrrrry angry... and you won't like me when I'm angry...||
||  38||128<br />24.11s||Cpl. Gabrielle||Sir! The rhynocs have blocked the way out of this next cave with a security door, and I don't think you'll be able to blast your way through this one. Recommend you land on the weights and carry them to the pressure sensitive security switches either side of the door. When in position press the > button to drop the weight. Press the } button once to look down, press it again to look up, sir! &[Land on item to pick it up. &[The > button drops item. &[Use the } button to change views.||
||  39||134<br />23.25s||Bianca||Listen to me, dragon... Spyro... this is serious now. The Sorceress is planning a trap for you, and if she catches you... believe me, you don't want to know what she's going to do... Look, I promise to take good care of the rest of the eggs. I mean it. Just take Hunter and go back home before... before... I can't say it, just go!||
||  40||170<br />22.19s||Hunter||Check it out, this is the world's fastest turbo-snowboard course! The local champions are the Sasquatch Six, a gang of yeti's on souped up snow-discs. I bet that you could outrace the lot of 'em! If you win, we get a huge pile of treasure! If you lose, I have to slick down the whole course with my tongue.||
||  41||120<br />21.76s||Hunter||Wow, you learn really fast! Then again, you are being trained by a master boarder... Speaking of which, I was just practicing a nearly impossible new move that I call the 'Gnasty Gnorc'. I had almost pulled it off when I suddenly ran smack into this dragon egg and wiped out! OK, I made that up, but you can have this egg...||
||  42||152<br />21.12s||Moneybags||Don't worry, Spyro, I won't be needing any more of your money... Now, now, don't look so surprised! I found one of the dragon eggs, and I'm going to sell it for a fortune back in Avalar! Errr... uh oh... why are you looking at me like that? I... errr... heh heh... I've got to be going now! Toodles!||
||  43||098<br />21.12s||Moneybags||Spyro! My my, how funny to see you here! Why, I haven't seen you since we defeated Ripto in Avalar... heh heh... Well, my business went into a slump after you left, so I came here and struck up a nice deal with the local Sorceress. Lovely woman, she is. Seems to be very fond of dragons, too...||
||  44||148<br />20.69s||Bentley||This might be our last stand, Spyro. The Sorceress plans to use this monster to destroy every iota of her opposition, beginning with the two of us. Alas, there is no time for ruminating, a battle awaits us... I will endeavor to assist you by means of a steady provision of combustible projectiles.||
||  45||110<br />20.69s||Billy the Mountain Goat||Those rhynocs have taken over! There'll be no stopping them unless we can smash their huts. Their huts are too big to smash with your kick attack, though. Try using your Stomp attack to smash them instead. I'll confuse them with taunting, while you stomp the huts, OK?||

||  46||120<br />20.48s||Mowat||I was playing catch with my pet wolf, Farley, but I accidentally threw his ball down this hole and he went in after it. Now he's stuck down there. I feel so helpless... sitting up here... listening to his steadily softening whimpers... don't cry, wolf... never cry, wolf...||
||  47||154<br />19.84s||Moneybags||Hmph... These gnomes think they're so talented... I happen to know a pretty good magic trick, myself! It's called the... incredible... magical... err, extending bridge trick. However, you'll need a few more gems to make a donation... After all, I am just a poor, starving amateur magician... &[Crossing bridge costs ^^^^ gems.||
||  48||142<br />19.84s||Princess Ami||Ohh... hee hee... Hi, Spyro! Isn't Prince Azrael just the dreamiest? The other fairies and wizards won't let us get married, so we're going to elope! ... By the way, Azrael says you can have this egg if you don't tell anyone where we went!||
||  49||136<br />19.84s||Moneybags||Say, Spyro, you're a sports fan aren't you? As you probably know, Frozen Altars is the birthplace of the great sport of cat hockey. Today's match is sold out, of course, but I just happen to have a spare ticket that I'll sell you for... say... a teensy weensy markup... &Pay ^^^ gems to enter cat hockey rink? &Sure, I love cat hockey. &I'll pass.||
||  50||114<br />19.63s||Zoe||Are you paying attention Sparx? I told you to use slide to target those crawdads. If you don't learn how to use all your skills you'll never survive the challenges that lie ahead, and Spyro would never forgive me for that. Use the @4L1@0 or @4R1@0 button, then move with the analog stick or directional button.||
||  51||142<br />19.41s||Sgt. Byrd||Good day, Spyro! I'd like to stay and chat, but I'm late for a... err... an engagement with a fairy friend of mine... err... she's just a friend, you understand... it's a strictly platonic relationship... it's certainly not a violation of military protocol whatsoever... What? What are you giving me that look for?||
||  52||156<br />19.41s||Gus||Hello, you must be Spyro! A lot of people are talking about all the things you've done for them... Do you think you could help find my girlfriend, Tara? She went off to raid the Tomb of the Stone Golem, and I haven't seen her since. I'd go look inside the tomb myself, but, you know, there's all these scorpions and stuff.||
||  53||116<br />19.41s||Bianca||Okay, dragon, you've managed to survive longer than I expected... but you haven't the slightest idea what sort of dangers lie ahead of you! I suggest you grab your cat friend and whatever eggs you have found and high-tail it back home while you still can... I'm telling you this for your own good, you know...||
||  54||158<br />18.77s||Dan||Ahhh, yet another dare-devil adventurer has come to rob our catacombs of loot! Let's just hope you're made of tougher stuff than the last guy... If you can survive the trials of our catacombs and answer my riddle, we will give you a prize befitting your efforts.||
||  55||160<br />18.56s||Sheriff Wyatt||Well, gosh darn it Spyro. I came in here to check on my prisoner only to find out he'd somehow got away again. Then, when I came in to look around for clues, one o' them rowdy dinosaurs went and locked me in. Now they're out there causin' all sorts o' trouble and there's not a thing I can do about it.||

||  56||156<br />18.56s||Moneybags||Well, Spyro, I bet you're glad to see me! It just happens that I know the, err... password to open the door to the Tomb of the Stone Golem... but, err... it seems to have slipped my mind for the moment... if you know what I mean. &Pay ^^^ gems to learn password? &OK, fine. &Some other time.||
||  57||120<br />18.35s||Ooga||Spyro! Are you on vacation too? I was having a lovely time with my friend until the lava toads stole all his bones again. I'd ask you to help, but some of the toads are hiding at the top of the tallest towers and I don't think you can fly that high.||
||  58||114<br />18.35s||Zoe||On your travels you'll notice butterflies that give you health, just like in the Dragon Worlds. Not only that but some butterflies will give you special powers, though only for a short time. Just eat any powerup butterfly and then press the < button to use that powerup. Your powerup is shown in the top right of the screen.||
||  59||152<br />18.13s||Moneybags||Hello there, Spyro, how do you like my new space monkey action figure? Incredibly life-like, don't you think? You'd almost think he was actually intelligent, heh heh. I suppose I might consider selling him to you... but you'll have to come up with a bit more cash first. &[^^^^ gems needed to free critter||
||  60||128<br />18.13s||Cpl. Gabrielle||Sir! The situation is this, yesterday at 1845 hours the rhynocs invaded. We defended as best we could, sir, but without your leadership we didn't put up an effective resistance. By 1900 hours the rest of the squad was captured and the rhynocs had complete control of the base.||
||  61||144<br />18.13s||Sparx||The easiest way to complete this time attack is to fly through all the honeycombs first, then pass through the bee-hives, then defeat the bees, and save the boat riding bears for last. Once you've solved it that way, you can always find ways to solve it faster.||
||  62||162<br />17.49s||Sparx||This is the world-famous Harbor Speedway, the most elite of all race courses! Only the world's top racers are allowed to compete here. The local champions are a group of blue-footed boobies who have never lost a race before.||
||  63||142<br />17.49s||Isabelle||Where have you been, James? We were supposed to meet in the temple an hour ago! And don't give me that old 'matters of national security' line again! ... I guess it doesn't matter, though... the whole temple is full of nasty cat witches, anyway. We'll just have to call off our date... that is, unless you want to battle the witches...||
||  64||118<br />17.49s||Nancy||Tonight is my big ice dance performance, and these hockey players are ruining it! Every time I start my routine, they come in and smack me with their sticks. Oh, I sure wish I had a partner... someone courageous and strong and handsome and... purple... who breathes fire...||
||  65||120<br />16.85s||Hunter||I can't believe it! How did you get so good already? Who knows, someday you might even break my course record. Naw. Anyway, I guess I should give you this other egg I found. I was going to keep it for a pet, but I can't get it to hatch.||
||  66||162<br />16.85s||Hunter||Where do these flying sheep saucers keep coming from? I just saw another one grab an egg and fly off! This one's super fast, but his saucer is damaged and it's leaving smoke rings... I think I can keep up with him as long as I can make it through the rings...||
||  67||152<br />16.64s||Moneybags||...pant pant... Drat! ...pant pant... Double drat! ...pant pant... Drat drat drat drat drat drat drat! ... pant pant... I never knew dragons were so fast... That's it... I give up... I'm retiring to Spooky Swamp to become a haiku poet...||
||  68||158<br />16.64s||Ali||Behind this door lie the five deadly trials of King Rover. No one has ever survived all five. In fact, it is so dangerous that I cannot let you through this first door unless you are able to solve my riddle...||
||  69||158<br />16.64s||Agent 9||One of those dogs with the funny hats put a curse on me, just 'cause I shot him in the butt a couple times. He said he turned my tail into a snake. Does it look like a snake to you? It does feel kinda funny, come to think of it. Hoo boy, that dog's gonna pay!||
||  70||152<br />16.64s||Bianca||Spyro, I know you don't trust me, but I want to help you stop the Sorceress. There's a way to open a hidden portal to her lair, but it'll take some very strong magic... If you can find more of the dragon eggs, I think my magic will be strong enough to open the portal. I'll come find you when you have enough eggs, okay?||
||  70||152<br />16.64s||Bianca||Spyro, I know you don't trust me, but I want to help you stop the Sorceress. There's a way to open a hidden portal to her lair, but it'll take some very strong magic... If you can find more of the dragon eggs, I think my magic will be strong enough to open the portal. I'll come find you when you have enough eggs, okay?||
||  71||098<br />16.64s||Moneybags||I'm getting paid a fortune to keep Sheila the Kangaroo locked up... heh heh... the pesky animal must have been causing a lot of trouble for that poor Sorceress... I suppose I could accidentally let the kangaroo escape... if you were to pay me, say...a small fee. &Pay ^^^ gems to free Sheila? &Sure. &No thanks.||
||  72||164<br />16.43s||Agent 9||Ooooooh weeee, I love the sizzle of a high energy laser on the back end of a rhynoc. Too bad the Sorceress didn't send more of 'em, I was really getting into the zone. Well, now that my island is safe again I guess I'll have to go rhynoc hunting elsewhere... Are you headed out? &Leave the level? &Yes &No||
||  73||154<br />16.43s||Moneybags||Spyro, did you know I happen to be a very talented amateur magician? My specialty is the, err... 'Amazing Extending Bridge' trick. I'd love to show you, but I need a small donation first... for my expenses, you understand... &Pay ^^^^ gems to cross the bridge? &Not again... Ok, fine... &I'm happy over here.||
||  74||156<br />16.43s||Tara||Well, well, look at you... showing up here to raid the tomb, after I've done all the work. I spend all day pressing switches and shoving boxes around, and you just waltz in here expecting to claim the treasure! Well, you might as well have it. It only turned out to be a lousy egg, anyway.||
||  75||134<br />16.43s||Bentley||I believe the denizens of this land plan to create a rocket propulsion device of some kind in order to help you with your journey. I'll try to be of some assistance, but I'm afraid you'll still need a representative from each world in order to complete the device.||
||  76||114<br />16.43s||Zoe||Now for the hard part. Being a maneuverable dragonfly, you can also slide in any direction. To slide, hold down the @4L1@0 or @4R1@0 button, then move with the analog stick or directional button. Try sliding up and down to hit the targets in this room.||
||  77||164<br />16.21s||Agent 9||What was that? Did you see a rhynoc? I thought I saw a rhynoc! Oooooh, take it from me, Spyro, never spend a week in a cage.  Uh, huh, next thing you know your whole island will be knee deep in rhynocs. Well, gotta go, Mr. Laser Blaster and I have a whole lotta work to do.||
||  78||118<br />16.21s||Moneybags||Just between you and me, Spyro, I'd love to let you into the ice dancing competition for free. Really, I would. Unfortunately, however, the upkeep on my zamboni is costing a fortune, so I'll have to ask you to find more gems before I let you in. &[Admission costs ^^^ gems.||
||  79||120<br />16.21s||Jasper||I'm almost ready to reveal my latest piece of real-time, four-dimensional performance art! I call it 'Hideous Exploding Witch, Number 9'. Now, if you can just light the three rockets around here, my masterpiece shall be complete...||
||  80||098<br />16.00s||Hunter||I see an egg at the bottom of this lake. I would go get it, but I don't want to get my fur all wet. Maybe you could get it. You can dive underwater by pressing the > button when you're on the surface, and charge underwater by holding down the > button. &[Press > button to dive underwater &[Press < button to swim &[Hold down > button to charge underwater||
||  81||102<br />15.79s||Moneybags||Sorry, Spyro, it is my sworn duty to make certain no one crosses these bellows. And you know perfectly well that nothing could ever sway me from obeying my sworn duty... that is, ahem, until you have a few more gems. &[Activating bellows costs ^^^ gems.||
||  82||120<br />15.57s||Hunter||Now that was a 900! I have to admit, you've got some skills, Spyro. But before you get too cocky, let's see if you can score some real points on the giant ski ramp. Do whatever moves you want, and see how many points you can get. &[Score 500 points on the giant ski ramp. &[Jump on ramp to do half-pipe moves. &[Don't jump on ramp to do rolls and flips.||
||  83||116<br />15.57s||Moneybags||Ahh, my good friend Spyro. The Sorceress caught this naughty bird letting off rockets in her fireworks factory, but I'm willing to release him into your custody... provided you pay his outstanding fines. &Pay ^^^ gems to free the penguin? &Of course. &Forget about it.||
||  84||160<br />15.36s||Deputy Roy||If you'd just calm down for a second and stop all that whoopin' and hollerin' I could tell you what's goin on. The Bailey gang are holed up in them buildings over there. You're gonna have to go in there an' flush 'em out. &Take on the Bailey gang? &Darn tootin'. &No Sir.||
||  85||170<br />15.36s||Hunter||YEEESSSSSSS! You schooled 'em like a bunch of frost-bitten, flat-footed, molasses-eating, lead-pants-wearing, cross-eyed glacier-trolls riding slabs of plywood with sandpaper on the bottom!!! ... And we won some shiny stuff, too.||
||  86||120<br />15.36s||Hunter||Hey, nice roll! Now let's see you pull a flip. Flips are exactly like rolls, only you push up or down instead of left or right. Just jump off the ramp, hold down the } button, and push up or down on the directional pad. &[Press < button to jump off ramp. &[Hold down } button and push & up or down on the directional pad. &[Land on the next ramp.||
||  87||104<br />15.36s||Moneybags||Spyro, you're just in time! I saw two egg thieves run through this door! Well... actually, they paid me to guard their hideout, but that's irrelevant. I'll happily let you through the gate to chase them down... for, ahem, a small finder's fee... &Pay ^^^ gems to enter the thieves' den? &Ok, ok... &Get lost, loser!||
||  88||136<br />15.15s||Moneybags||Head on in, Spyro, it should be a thrilling match! In fact... heh heh.. I've even placed a little wager on the rhynoc team... let's just hope the local team doesn't have any last minute accidents...||
||  89||138<br />15.15s||Hunter||Spyro, you're just in time! A rhynoc skateboard gang has challenged us to a race. They said you're slower than a Molten Crater fire slug. I stuck up for you, though! I told them I've seen some pretty fast fire slugs.||
||  90||106<br />15.15s||Sebastian the Seal||While I was gone, my friends borrowed the rhynocs' submarine... then they took it for a joy ride... and then they smashed it into a big pile of rocks. Oddly enough, the rhynocs failed to see the humor in the story and stuffed my friends in the jail behind you.||
||  90||106<br />15.15s||Sebastian the Seal||While I was gone, my friends borrowed the rhynocs' submarine... then they took it for a joy ride... and then they smashed it into a big pile of rocks. Oddly enough, the rhynocs failed to see the humor in the story and stuffed my friends in the jail behind you.||
||  91||108<br />14.93s||Sparx||Now that you've completed the challenge, you could go for your best time. Try cutting corners and charging for extra speed. Also, remember that completing the challenge in order may not be the fastest way, try experimenting.||
||  92||120<br />14.72s||Hunter||This one's freestyle, Spyro! Do whatever tricks you want off the ramp. If you jump off the ramp, you can do half-pipe moves. If you don't jump off the ramp, you can do rolls and flips. The harder the trick, the more points you'll score. &[Score 500 points on the giant ski ramp &[Jump on ramp to do half-pipe moves. &[Don't jump on ramp to do rolls and flips.||
||  93||156<br />14.72s||Hunter||Nice shootin', comrade! Where'd you learn to aim like that? Oh, by the way, Bianca wanted me to give you this egg. She says she accidentally turned it into a woolly mammoth for five minutes, but it should still be ok.||
||  94||098<br />14.72s||Hunter||Yo, Spyro! I just found one of those portal thingamajigs that leads to a different world, but you'll have to glide to get across to it. Press the < button to jump, then press the < button again while you're in the air to glide! Just follow me... &[Press < button to jump. &[Press < button in mid-air to glide.||
||  95||154<br />14.51s||The Great Zamboni||Would you like to see a magic trick? Watch carefully, as you can see there is nothing up my left sleeve, nothing up my right sleeve, but now with a wave of my hands and the magic word... ALAKAZAM!||
||  96||152<br />14.51s||Moneybags||Well, well, Spyro, look what I have here. It's a life-size space monkey action figure, complete with a fully operational laser! I'd love to let him out so you can play with him, but the Sorceress seems to think he's a menace. &Pay ^^^^ gems to free the monkey? &Release him. &Nah, you can keep him.||
||  97||124<br />14.51s||Ling Ling||Spyro! Rhynocs have been harassing us all day. The workers haven't been able to harvest the bamboo needed for the whirligig to take you to Evening Lake. We've tried asking them to leave, but there's no reasoning with them.||
||  98||104<br />14.51s||Moneybags||Well, Spyro, it's good to see you! This gate I'm guarding happens to be the secret entrance to an egg thief hideout... Of course, I can't let you enter with a clean conscience... At least not without paying a small fee. &[Entering thief hideout costs ^^^ gems.||
||  99||102<br />14.51s||Moneybags||Well, well, if it isn't my favorite dragon! The Sorceress has put me in charge of guarding these bellows. However, I suppose I might look the other way if I was distracted by counting gems. &Pay ^^^ gems to activate bellows? &Sure, whatever. &No way, you doofus.||
|| 100||162<br />14.29s||Sparx||The easiest way to beat this time trial is to do it in the following order: seagulls, arches, lobsters, fish. Complete each one before moving on to the next.||
|| 101||162<br />14.29s||Sparx||Remember, you don't have to follow the red dots exactly. Try to take short cuts between rings when you can. Also, for the fastest speed, always try to fly as low as you can. &[Cut corners between the green rings. &[Flying lower gives you extra speed.||
|| 102||170<br />14.29s||Hunter||Hi, Spyro! Did you see Bianca? She was really worried about you when you went off to fight the Sorceress. It was pretty funny. She tries to play it cool, but she was scared stiff until you came back safe.||
|| 103||144<br />14.29s||Sparx||Remember, you don't have to follow the red dots exactly. Try to take short cuts between rings when you can. Also, for the fastest speed, always try to fly as low as you can. &[Cut corners between the green rings. &[Flying lower gives you extra speed.||
|| 104||140<br />14.29s||Greta||Oh hewwo, it's good to see you again, Spywo. That naughty sorcewess has stolen the pwofessor's wocket plans and I'm on a secwet mission to find them. Handel was supposed to meet me here but I can't find him anywhere. Maybe you could help?||
|| 105||108<br />14.29s||Sparx||You won't win the race without using the blue turbo stars. Try to use as many as possible, even if it means leaving the red dots, but remember to fly though the rings or you'll be disqualified. &[Use the blue turbo stars. &[Fly through all green rings||
|| 106||098<br />14.08s||Zoe||Hi Spyro. To look left or right, press the @4L2@0 or @4R2@0 buttons. To quickly center the camera behind you, press the @4L1@0 or @4R1@0 button. You can look all around by holding the } button down. &[Use @0L2@4 and @0R2@4 buttons to rotate camera. &[Press @0L1@4 or @0R1@4 to center the camera. &[Hold } to look around.||
|| 107||140<br />14.08s||Handel||Hi, Agent 9! Behind those doors are some pwetty scary ninjas! I bet you could use your sharp shooter skills to take them out. Wemember, pwess the { button to shoot and use @4L1@0 and @4R1@0 to dodge left and wight. &[Defeat the ninjas to find the baby dragon egg. &[Press the } button to enter sniper mode &[Use @0L1@4 and @0R1@4 to zoom in and out while in sniper mode||

|| 109||158<br />13.87s||Jamal||That was indeed a battle for the ages! You're the first dragon to win the competition in over a thousand years. I proudly present you this year's grand prize...||
|| 110||120<br />13.87s||Mowat||Hey, you found Farley! How can I ever thank you? I mean, I could give you this old egg, but Farley's been chewing on it and it's kinda slimey... oh well, it's the thought that counts, right?||
|| 111||116<br />13.87s||Zoe||Hi Spyro. This is a superflame powerup. You'll find more just like it scattered throughout all the worlds. Why don't you try this one out by using it to break all these planters. I think I saw a rhynoc hide an egg in one of them.||
|| 112||120<br />13.87s||Hunter||Whoa, you must be a natural! Now let's see if you can pull off a half-pipe spin move. The blue ramps are half-pipes. You can do a spin move by jumping at the top of the blue ramp, then steering left or right in the air. &[Press < button at top of blue ramp to jump. &[Steer left or right in air to spin.||
|| 113||130<br />13.65s||Sgt. Byrd||My tactical instincts told me the Sorceress would attack you here, so I flew in to help out. It seems my rocket launchers don't affect this creature, but I can assist you by dropping ammunition. Now get in there and fight the good fight!||
|| 114||164<br />13.44s||Professor||Ahh, Agent 9, my favorite pupil... welcome back to my island laboratory! I'm afraid rhynocs have taken over the whole island... perhaps you could stop them before they destroy all my research.||
|| 115||154<br />13.44s||The Marvelous Magnifico||Shhh! Spyro, don't tell anyone but we've stolen some magic from the Sorceress. We're hiding here whilst we practice using it. Unfortunately we've had a bit of an accident and turned everything into crystal, and it seems to have aggravated the indiginous creatures.||
|| 116||170<br />13.44s||Bianca||Your best chance to defeat her is to borrow my flying saucer. I've cast some spells on it to give it extra firepower and unlimited flying time... but the rest is going to be up to you... You've come this far, Spyro, I know you can beat her!||
|| 117||116<br />13.44s||Zoe||Excellent work Sparx, and I see that you've gained another new ability. Now if you hold down the @4L1,L2, R1 and R2@0 buttons at the same time, Sparx will point to any treasure still hanging around.||
|| 118||126<br />13.44s||Sparx||Spyro, these are the famous racing grounds known as Country Speedway. They offer two challenges here: a timed obstacle course, or a race against the local speed champions.||
|| 119||152<br />13.01s||Zoe||That last egg must have had some extra magic, because it gave Sparx two new abilities. Now he can break open treasure chests, and, using the Atlas, he can warp you to any level. Just select the level you want and press the > button.||
|| 120||138<br />13.01s||Hunter||Now that the rhynocs are gone, do you want to try a real challenge? I know you're fast, but I bet you can't defeat all the crabs on the course and still beat me in a race! Want to give it a shot? &Accept Hunter's challenge? &You're on, pal! &No dice...||
|| 121||106<br />13.01s||Smelt the Seal||Bluto the rhynoc has challenged us to a naval battle. Our speed boat versus his nuclear shark submarine. If we win, we get the dragon egg he's guarding. If we lose, we have to spend a month in K.P.||
|| 122||138<br />12.80s||Hunter||Sheesh, I can't believe you beat me! You must have been practicing the whole time I thought you were looking for eggs... Hey, speaking of which, one of those crabs was guarding this one...||
|| 123||100<br />12.80s||Hunter||You can go for the course record now, if you want. Whenever you hop on a skateboard, a timer will start. Score as many points as you can until the timer expires or you wipe out. Good luck!||
|| 124||158<br />12.80s||Jamal||You may now enter the championship round... However, this is an exceedingly dangerous sport. Might I suggest you quit while you're still in one piece? &Enter the final round? &Bring it on! &I'm outta here.||
|| 125||138<br />12.80s||Hunter||Right on! You can use my special racing board. Every time you do a trick, it builds up turbo charge. You can use your turbos at any time by pressing the > button. Good luck! &[Do tricks to get turbos. &[Use turbos by pressing the > button. &[Beat all rhynocs in 3 lap race.||
|| 126||104<br />12.80s||Shale||I'm playing a game of hide and seek with my friends. If I can't find where they've hidden their heads they won't let me join the Tiki Lodge. Help me put them back together and I'll make you an honorary member.||
|| 127||098<br />12.59s||Zoe||Nice work Sparx! You've beaten the Crawdad King and found the lost egg. Not only that but some of the dragon magic seems to have rubbed off on you. Now you can pick up gems when they're even further away from Spyro.||
|| 128||158<br />12.59s||Jamal||Oooh, I am terribly sorry, but that is incorrect. Unless you can solve the riddle, we cannot trust you behind the controls of something so dangerous as a fully loaded demolition hovercraft.||
|| 129||162<br />12.59s||Sparx||The red dots mark the race course, and you have to fly through ALL of the green checkpoint rings. The blue stars will give you a speed boost so fly through as many of them as you can. &[Fly through all green rings &[Fly through blue stars for a speed boost||
|| 130||158<br />12.59s||Dan||Here is my riddle:\ I am a vessel without hinges, lock or lid,\ yet, within my walls, a golden treasure is hid.\ What am I?||
|| 131||136<br />12.59s||Moneybags||Off you go, then... But you'll regret it... Many years from now you'll sit on your old dragon haunches and wish with all your might that you could have just one more chance to see a game of cat hockey...||
|| 132||110<br />12.59s||Billy the Mountain Goat||You can get up really steep cliffs like this one with your double-jump.

|| 134||098<br />12.37s||Zoe||I'm sorry, Spyro, but you seem to be playing a hacked version of this game. This may be an illegal copy. Since this copy has been modified, you may experience problems that would not occur on a legal copy.||
|| 135||170<br />12.37s||Bianca||This place is where the Sorceress kept all her treasure, but after she was defeated a bunch of thieves came and stole it. If you can catch the thieves, you're more than welcome to keep the treasure!||
|| 136||122<br />12.37s||Moneybags||\           You've made a wise choice...\        It will mean more eggs for you...\              And more gems for me. \           Best of all, Spyro...\        I can stop speaking Haiku.\           What a sweet relief!||
|| 137||138<br />12.37s||Crazy Ed||Alrighty then. Press the < button to speed on up, and when you get a sub in your sights, the torpedo will start to lock on. If you get a good lock-on, fire away with the { button. &[Press < to speed up. &[Wait for red circles to lock on. &[Fire with { button!||
|| 138||120<br />12.16s||Hunter||You can go for the course record now, if you want. Whenever you hop on a skateboard, a timer will start. Score as many points as you can until the timer expires or you wipe out. Good luck!||
|| 139||164<br />12.16s||Professor||There's another door at the end of this beach, and rhynocs will keep coming out until you shoot the red panic button. Work your way up the beach by dodging and using the natural cover on the right side. &[Use @0L1@4 and @0R1@4 to dodge left and right. &[Shoot the rhynocs to reach the door and retake the beach!||
|| 140||156<br />12.16s||Moneybags||I am dreadfully sorry, Spyro, but I can't let common riff raff into the Tomb of the Stone Golem. Only the crustiest of the upper crust may pass through here. &[Entering tomb costs ^^^ gems.||
|| 141||162<br />11.95s||Sparx||Go through every single blue turbo star that you can, even if it means straying from the course. Just remember not to miss any rings, or you'll be disqualified. &[Use the blue turbo stars. &[Fly through all green rings||
|| 142||126<br />11.95s||Sparx||Here's a hint. Try completing each challenge in order. Start with the rings, then get all the tractors, the cows, and save the planes for last. It's not the fastest way, but it is the easiest.||
|| 143||152<br />11.95s||Bianca||You did it, Spyro! You found enough of the dragon eggs for me to unlock the portal. Once I've opened it, you can confront the Sorceress whenever you're ready... but be careful, she'll be expecting you...||

|| 145||164<br />11.73s||Professor||These indicators show that a bunch of rhynocs are hiding behind the display screen. I'll switch on the view pedestal, and you shoot them as they attack! I recommend using your sniper mode. &[Shoot the rhynocs as they appear in front of the screen. &[Press the } button to enter sniper mode.||

|| 148||164<br />11.52s||Professor||The lab's clear, and it smells better in here already! Follow me outside, where I expect we'll find some rhynocs wearing armor. You'll need a more powerful weapon to defeat them.||
|| 149||162<br />11.52s||Sparx||The birds said they didn't feel too bad losing to a dragon. After all, people say dragons used to own all the speed records here, a thousand years ago.||
|| 150||164<br />11.52s||Professor||Just as I thought, the machine room is overrun with birds. To target the birds in their nests, you'll want to use sniper mode, then zoom in for pinpoint accuracy. &[Press the } button to enter sniper mode. &[Use @0L1@4 and @0R1@4 to zoom in and out while in sniper mode.||
|| 151||116<br />11.52s||Moneybags||Heh heh... what a sucker... err, that is... It's a far, far better thing you do today, Spyro, than you have ever done, and... err... well so forth, et cetera, you get the idea...||
|| 152||118<br />11.52s||Moneybags||Step right up, Spyro. Behind this door is the single greatest show on earth! That's right! Ice dancing! Season tickets are available, but you'll have to act fast. &Pay ^^^ gems to enter ice rink? &Sure, it's only money. &Take off, hoser!||

|| 169||146<br />11.09s||Bentley||I will gladly help you on your quest, Spyro, but first I must attend to my young sibling. I'm afraid he may have gotten himself into trouble during my absence.||
|| 170||164<br />11.09s||Professor||A vast number of rhynocs are waiting to ambush us as soon as I lower this force field. I expect they'll keep coming until you shoot the red panic button next to the door where they come out. &[Shoot the red panic button to lock the rhynocs in.||

|| 178||142<br />10.88s||Moneybags||Say, Spyro, if you had a bit more money, I think I could make a deal with the wizards to raise these steps. I'm afraid that's the only way you'll be able to get to the castle. &[^^^ gems needed to use steps.||
|| 179||136<br />10.88s||Ernest||Eustace and I were having a snowman building competition when the Sorceress brought them to life with a spell. Since then they've been stomping around building ice walls and generally causing trouble.||

|| 182||098<br />10.88s||Moneybags||Ahhh, Spyro, I love your sweet naivete... Your kind-hearted nature might be your downfall someday, but for the time being it's making me rich!||
|| 183||098<br />10.88s||Hunter||There's definitely something shiny at the bottom of this hole. I was about to jump down there, but I think I hear running water and I hate to get wet. It's a cat thing.||
|| 185||142<br />10.67s||Jack||I just bought some insta-sprout-ultra-super-grow seeds from a bear with a bag of gems. He said they were magic, but I can't make them do anything. You can have a couple, if you like.||

|| 188||164<br />10.45s||Professor||Ah, it'll be just like old times! Try shooting these dummies to get warmed up, but... err, be careful, I think a rhynoc might be hiding among them... &[Shoot all dummies, and the occasional rhynoc...||
|| 189||154<br />10.45s||The Astounding Arturo||Well, I suppose I could show you my new trick. As long as you promise not to tell the Great Zamboni, he steals all my best work... ALAKAZAM!||

|| 198||134<br />10.24s||Zoe||When I saw that giant stingray I thought you were a goner, Sparx, but you sure showed him. Now the magic from the egg has made you even stronger, so you can take one more hit for Spyro.||
|| 199||152<br />10.24s||Zoe||Just before you kicked the Sorceress's big, fat, ugly butt she built a factory to make robotic bugs to fight Sparx, but I don't think they're any match for him. &Enter Bugbot Factory bonus world? &Yes. &No.||
|| 200||120<br />10.24s||Hunter||Isn't this the wildest skateboard park you've ever seen? Once you've mastered a few tricks, you could score huge points in this place! What do you say I show you some moves? &Learn some tricks? &Of course! &Some other time...||

|| 204||138<br />10.24s||Hunter||Sheesh, what happened? I could beat these guys with my tail tied behind my back! I hope you do better this time, or we'll never live it down... &Race the rhynocs? &Bring 'em on! &Some other time...||

|| 207||142<br />10.03s||Moneybags||You know, come to think of it, the wizards only agreed to raise the steps. They never said they wouldn't lower them again... heh heh... Those guys are pretty clever, aren't they?||
|| 208||156<br />9.81s||Hunter||What, you're not afraid of a few robotic sharks, are you? Or is it the rhynocs with ultra-explosive JX-5 tracking ammo that have you worried?||

|| 212||118<br />9.81s||Doug||Heh heh... I put up ice blocks this morning so Bob wouldn't beat me to the ice fishing hole... If you want to try out the hole, you can borrow this fishing lure I've been using.||
|| 213||118<br />9.81s||Nancy||We did it! That was my best performance ever! I guess one of the judges didn't like it, though. He threw this egg at me instead of a rose. Why don't you have it.||
|| 214||100<br />9.81s||Hunter||Now that you've mastered the basics, let's see you do some stunts! Try using the < or } button to jump off ramps and turn in the air...||
|| 215||134<br />9.60s||Zoe||Hi again, Spyro. This powerup can make you invincible, but only for a short while. Use it to get by these flame spitters... you'll find an egg when you get past them.||
|| 216||158<br />9.60s||Allgeier||I've waited seven thousand years for someone to solve that riddle... Now I can finally head off to Seashell Shore to bury some bones!||
|| 217||170<br />9.60s||Bianca||I don't know how she did it, Spyro, but the Sorceress must have survived that last battle! She's been waiting here all this time, saving up her magic to destroy you!||
|| 218||126<br />9.60s||Hunter||Spyro, you're not gonna believe this, but there are sheep saucers and space cows all over this place! We gotta stop 'em before they abduct anybody!||
|| 219||152<br />9.60s||Zoe||Sparx can help you find the rest of the gems. When you hold down @4L1, L2, R1, and R2@0 at the same time, he will point to the nearest treasure in that area.||
|| 220||098<br />9.60s||Moneybags||Well, don't worry, Spyro. Sheila won't stay in jail forever... The Sorceress is thinking about having her executed next Thursday.||
|| 221||106<br />9.39s||Sheila||Oh, hi, Spyro! Some of my seal friends are trying to take down a rhynoc fortress! I'm about to go and lend a foot... I love the smell of singed rhynoc in the morning!||

||1004||106<br />13.23s||Sandy the Seal||We had a dragon egg for you, but we used it to test our ultra-high-speed-super-fluidity tunnel. The good news is that it made it to the end of the tunnel without a scratch! The bad news is that there's no way to get it back out now.||
||1005||160<br />12.16s||Sheriff Wyatt||Well I'll be, so that's how my prisoners keep escaping! Here take this dinosaur egg away before it hatches and causes more trouble. I think it must have been the runt of the litter though.||
||1005||160<br />12.16s||Sheriff Wyatt||Well I'll be, so that's how my prisoners keep escaping! Here take this dinosaur egg away before it hatches and causes more trouble. I think it must have been the runt of the litter though.||

||1006||156<br />11.95s||Hunter||OK. By the way, if you see Bianca around, can you tell her to meet me here? I... uh... promised I'd give her scuba lessons once the sharks were gone.||
||1007||156<br />11.31s||Hunter||I've been training my new pet manta ray to carry the latest technology super-high-impact underwater missile launchers! Wanna ride him, and try blastin' some sharks? &Ride manta ray and shoot sharks? &Yes &No||
||1008||120<br />11.31s||Pablo||Those crummy rhynocs forced us to build a statue of the Sorceress. Then, after we built it, she complained it was too ugly! If you ask me, the statue is much prettier than she is.||
||1009||142<br />11.31s||Moneybags||You have chosen wisely, Spyro. I'll tell the wizards to raise the steps immediately... And, err, best of luck rescuing that princess, or whatever it is you're up to...||
||1010||120<br />10.67s||Hunter||Alright, you nailed it. Now let's see if you can do a 900! Get as much height as you can, spin two and a half revolutions in the air and land back on the ramp. &[Press < button at top of blue ramp. &[Steer left or right to do 3 spins. &[Land it.||
||1011||152<br />10.67s||Moneybags||Heh heh, you've always had a weakness for helping silly little creatures, haven't you, Spyro? Ah well, I suppose there couldn't be any harm in letting him out, could there?||
||1012||108<br />10.24s||Sparx||Hi Spyro! There are 2 flying challenges available here in Mushroom Speedway. You can either try Time Attack or Race the Butterflies.||
||1013||098<br />10.24s||Rocky||I'm late for a dinner party at the Tiki Lodge, and the portal to my home just stopped working. Maybe the portal will reactivate after a few more dragons hatch. &[^^ eggs needed to open portal.||
||1014||098<br />10.24s||Hunter||I saw something shiny in that cave over there...let's go check it out! You can get there by hovering. To hover, just press the } button at the end of your glide! &[Press the } button at the end of your glide to hover. &[Hovering will give you extra height and distance.||
||1015||154<br />10.03s||The Great Zamboni||You want to see the trick again? Well, alright but I want you to know this isn't as easy as it looks... ALAKAZAM!||
||1016||154<br />10.03s||The Fantastic Frederico||Ok, I'll show you again. If you watch carefully maybe you'll be able to see how it's done... ABRACADABRA!||
||1017||158<br />10.03s||Allgeier||I see you've managed to survive the trials of the catacombs. Now let's find out if your wits are as quick as your feet. Do you remember the riddle?||
||1018||154<br />9.17s||The Fantastic Frederico||All this magic is just misdirection you know. Which is why I'm going to start that whirlwind over there... ABRACADABRA!||
||1019||156<br />9.17s||Moneybags||OK, there was no password. I was standing in front of the wall switch. What are you going to do, sue me?||
||1020||140<br />9.17s||Agent 9||Hey Spyro, I'm helping a kid called Handel recover some secret rocket plans the Sorceress stole. You know I'm always ready to kick some rhynoc booty.||
||1021||108<br />9.17s||Sparx||Ok, you're going to race the butterflies. You have to fly through ALL of the green checkpoint rings in order. The red dots will lead the way. &[Fly through all green rings &[Use the red dots to guide you.||
||1022||102<br />9.17s||Moneybags||What? NO? What else are you going to do with all those gems? Buy flying lessons? (Heh heh) that was a good one...||
||1023||102<br />9.17s||Cumulus||Our sun has gone out. We can make a new one with our lava fusion cauldron and three sun seeds, but they keep burning out before we can get them in the pot.||
||1024||170<br />8.53s||Bianca||Oh, by the way, Hunter is around here somewhere. He's been tinkering with one of his new toys all day, and he wants to show it off. You should go see him!||
||1025||120<br />8.53s||Hunter||Let's start with something easy. You can jump off the end of ramps by pressing the < button. I'll show you how to do it once, then it's your turn. &[Press < button at top of ramp to jump.||
||1026||120<br />8.53s||Ooga||What did you have to come back for? Now he's going to do his whole routine again! Well, here we go...||
||1027||120<br />8.53s||Hunter||Just press the < button at the top of the ramp to jump off it. Try jumping as close to the top as possible to get the most hang time.||
||1028||152<br />8.53s||Zoe||Once you complete Sparx's special tasks in Sunrise Spring Home and Midday Garden Home, he will gain new abilities that will make collecting gems much easier!||
||1029||110<br />8.53s||Billy the Mountain Goat||You see that rhynoc guy up ahead? He's still mad at us for hanging his underpants on top of this tree. We'll just wait over here while you give him a swift kick. &[Press > or { to kick enemies.||

||1030||098<br />8.11s||Snappy the Seal||I want to repay you for saving me from that octopus. We can help you use this hot air balloon, if you just bring back someone from each of the other worlds.||
||1031||100<br />8.11s||Hunter||Caught all the lizards yet? If you're having trouble catching them, don't be afraid to use your flame breath while on the skateboard.||
||1032||136<br />7.89s||Bartholomew||I knew you'd do it. Go and show him not to mess with us. Remember to block his high punches, and hit him low when he tries to block. &[Use the > button for a quick jab. &[Use the < button for a body blow. &[Use the { button for the big hookaroo. &[Use the } button to block high. &[Bentley blocks low automatically.||
||1033||146<br />7.89s||Bartholomew||Hey brainiac, you're supposed to be smart. Why don't you try pushing those blocks around to bridge that gap?||
||1034||164<br />7.89s||Agent 9||Hiya, Spyro... I'm just off to patrol the island again, you know, in case any rhynocs decided to come crawling back...||
||1035||124<br />7.89s||Bentley||Ah, a fine day for a bit of a walk. I was just heading to the top of my favorite hill...||
||1036||110<br />7.68s||Billy the Mountain Goat||I think my taunting is wearing them down! Remember, just jump and press the triangle button to stomp those huts. &[Smash the huts with your stomp move. &[Eliminate all the blue enemies.||

||1038||146<br />7.47s||Bentley||I'm afraid my home is still infested with rhynocs, I'll return when they are dealt with.||
||1039||138<br />7.47s||Hunter||Heh heh, what's the matter, getting chicken on me? Bwaaak bwaaak bwaaaaaak! Bwak bwaak bwak bwak bwaaaaaaaaaak!||

||1041||118<br />7.47s||Bob||You can hop on the cannon and try shooting the ice block if you want to, but I'm warning you, it's a lot harder than it looks!||
||1042||144<br />7.47s||Sparx||We won an egg for first prize! Those dumblebees should have known better than to challenge a dragon to a flying race.||
||1043||136<br />7.47s||Moneybags||Heh heh... I hate to spoil the game for you, Spyro, but I've already bribed the local team to forfeit to the rhynocs.||
||1044||098<br />7.47s||Mayor Leo||I guess you just hop in the balloon, now... Don't ask me how it works, I just showed up for the punch and cookies, a ha ha ha.||
||1045||158<br />7.04s||Dan||Don't try to answer the riddle now. You'll need to save your breath to survive the trials of the catacombs.||
||1046||118<br />7.04s||Bob||I've been trying to clear the way with this cannon, but it doesn't even shoot straight. I haven't been able to hit a dang thing all morning.||

||1052||108<br />6.83s||Hunter||Whoooa! A bunch of sheep in flying saucers just came out of nowhere and started blasting up the race course!||
||1053||100<br />6.83s||Councillor George||Oh my! Oh my! Can you help us? Hordes of ferocious rhynocs have overrun our town and kidnapped the mayor.||
||1054||104<br />6.61s||Stoney||Hey, there goes another one. He was really fast...maybe if I activate the supercharge you'll be able to catch him.||
||1055||106<br />6.61s||Stu the Seal||We never would have crashed that submarine if Sal hadn't tried that hand-brake u-turn during an inverted barrel roll.||
