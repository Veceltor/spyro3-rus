This rhynoc is too big to charge. You'll have to flame him using the { button.

Hi Spyro! Each time a fairy zaps you, like this...

That means your progress is saved. If you get into trouble you'll return to the last place you got zapped.

Councillor George

Oh my! Oh my! Can you help us? Hordes of ferocious rhynocs have overrun our town and kidnapped the mayor.

Are you a dragon? I never believed you really existed.

Would you like a chicken sandwich? They're very good.

Those pesky rhynocs are back again, but I'm sure you'll soon sort them out.

Citizen Paulus

Let me catch my breath and I'll kick that other guy's butt.

We showed those two bullies. If they hadn't outnumbered me two to one, I'd have finished them off ages ago.

Have you seen any giant chickens around here?

Thank you for rescuing my town. As mayor I award you with one of our famous giant chicken eggs.

I'm sorry, that was the ugliest chicken I've ever seen.

Citizen Horace

Whoo I'm dizzy.

Thanks for the help, but I think I would have worn him down in a minute.

Have you seen any of our giant chickens? The rhynocs have been trying to eat them all.

Look, a chicken turned up. I hope it's not the only one left.

To Whom it May Concern: Sheila the Kangaroo is currently otherwise detained -- by me. Please return in a few years.\      -The Sorceress

Spyro, thanks for dropping by, but I'm currently busy in my home world. Come visit me there.\          -Sheila

Come on in!\     -Sheila

What! Marco sent you here? I've got a restraining order against him.

If you see Marco please tell him I've moved out.

Hey Spyro, there are rhynocs everywhere. Maybe I can find some peace and quiet at the top of the tower...

Alas, I have lost my love, guarded by evil rhynocs at the top of yonder tower. Can you rescue her for me?

Attention dragon: if you ever want to see your mangy cat friend again, you had better leave here at once!\     -The Sorceress

Hi Spyro. I found this gladiator training arena and it makes a pretty cool skate park! Care for a test of your boarding skills? &Start boarding challenge now? &Yes. &No.

Are you ready for a challenge now? &Start boarding challenge now? &Yes. &No.

I bet you can't catch all fifteen of the lizards running around here... Just come back if you want some boarding tips from the master. &[Catch the lizards.

Yeah, maybe you'd better practice a bit first... Just come back here when you're up for a challenge.

Having trouble? If you use the < button to jump off the ramps you'll get extra height and distance.

Caught all the lizards yet? If you're having trouble catching them, don't be afraid to use your flame breath while on the skateboard.

Hey that was great! And while you were boarding, I found this in a lizard burrow.

Now that you've mastered the basics, let's see you do some stunts! Try using the < or } button to jump off ramps and turn in the air...

This is the most fun I've had since we chased King Flippy on the manta ray.

Alright, if you can catch all the lizards without wiping out and before time runs out, I  might be able to scrounge up another egg. It's not gonna be easy, though... &Start difficult boarding challenge now? &Yes. &No.

If you want to try to catch those lizards, I'll start the clock now. &Start difficult boarding challenge now? &Yes. &No.

Go get 'em, Spyro!

Well whenever you're ready, come and talk to me.

Awww, too bad... maybe you'll do better this time. &Try difficult boarding challenge again? &Yes. &No.

Whoa, that was sweet! And look, there was another egg in the lizard burrow.

You can go for the course record now, if you want. Whenever you hop on a skateboard, a timer will start. Score as many points as you can until the timer expires or you wipe out. Good luck!
