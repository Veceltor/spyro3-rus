Dear Spirow, or whatever your name is, GIVE IT UP! I've got the monkey, and I'm not giving it back.\     Love,\     The Sorceress
Sorry... lab taken over... rhynocs everywhere...\       -Agent 9
Come on in, it's laser time!\        -Agent 9
Oh hewwo, it's good to see you again, Spywo. That naughty sorcewess has stolen the pwofessor's wocket plans and I'm on a secwet mission to find them. Handel was supposed to meet me here but I can't find him anywhere. Maybe you could help?
It looks like you'll have to use this cannon to get across here, simply climb aboard. As for me I just have to fwee my mind...
It looks like the sorcewess has already used the plans to build her own wocket. We have to destwoy it. Just follow me.
Hey, look what was in the wocket. They must have been twying to put it into orbit.
If you see Handel tell him I've gone back to Evening Lake to finish work on the pwofessor's wocket.
Uh oh. You'll have to use this combo powerup to take out these fire dwagons. It will allow you to superfwy and superfwame at the same time. &[Defeat the two flying fire dragons &[The fire dragons will grow back their tails when left alone.
Here have this. I fished it out of the molten wava.
You can't afford to waste any time Spywo. If you leave the fire dwagons alone their tails will gwo back.
I knew those monsters would be no match for you.
Hey Spyro, I'm helping a kid called Handel recover some secret rocket plans the Sorceress stole. You know I'm always ready to kick some rhynoc booty.
Hi, Agent 9! Behind those doors are some pwetty scary ninjas! I bet you could use your sharp shooter skills to take them out. Wemember, pwess the { button to shoot and use @4L1@0 and @4R1@0 to dodge left and wight. &[Defeat the ninjas to find the baby dragon egg. &[Press the } button to enter sniper mode &[Use @0L1@4 and @0R1@4 to zoom in and out while in sniper mode
Thanks for wescuing me, you'd better look after this egg before the whynocs twy to blow that up too.
Thanks for helping me Agent 9. Those whynocs never knew what hit them.
I think I can see an egg behind you, but it's out of weach. You'll have to take the long way wound through all these whynocs to get to it.
Watch out for that wava, it looks super hot.
