Ahh, Agent 9, my favorite pupil... welcome back to my island laboratory! I'm afraid rhynocs have taken over the whole island... perhaps you could stop them before they destroy all my research.

Ah, it'll be just like old times! Try shooting these dummies to get warmed up, but... err, be careful, I think a rhynoc might be hiding among them... &[Shoot all dummies, and the occasional rhynoc...

A vast number of rhynocs are waiting to ambush us as soon as I lower this force field. I expect they'll keep coming until you shoot the red panic button next to the door where they come out. &[Shoot the red panic button to lock the rhynocs in.

There's another door at the end of this beach, and rhynocs will keep coming out until you shoot the red panic button. Work your way up the beach by dodging and using the natural cover on the right side. &[Use @0L1@4 and @0R1@4 to dodge left and right. &[Shoot the rhynocs to reach the door and retake the beach!

You'll need to take out all the rhynocs to secure the beach... and don't forget to dodge! &[Shoot the red panic button &[Eliminate all rhynocs &[Use @0L1@4 and @0R1@4 to dodge

&These indicators show that a bunch of rhynocs are hiding behind the display screen. I'll switch on the view pedestal, and you shoot them as they attack! I recommend using your sniper mode. &[Shoot the rhynocs as they appear in front of the screen. &[Press the } button to enter sniper mode.

Try not to fall off the pedestal. I recommend using sniper mode to take out these targets. &[Press the } button to enter sniper mode.

You cleared them out! Let's see what kind of shape the machine room is in... I have a feeling the rhynocs haven't been keeping it too clean.

Just as I thought, the machine room is overrun with birds. To target the birds in their nests, you'll want to use sniper mode, then zoom in for pinpoint accuracy. &[Press the } button to enter sniper mode. &[Use @0L1@4 and @0R1@4 to zoom in and out while in sniper mode.

Nice work, Agent 9! Err, I'm not sure if this is a bird egg or dragon egg... what do you think?

The lab's clear, and it smells better in here already! Follow me outside, where I expect we'll find some rhynocs wearing armor. You'll need a more powerful weapon to defeat them.

By my calculations, the bombs in this handy vending machine should be highly effective against armor. Give it a shot. &[Press the > button to throw bombs. &[To carefully aim your throw, press and hold down the > button.

Just a few more enemies left! You can do it!

Thank you very much for saving my laboratory. Now I can resume thinking...

Now I can switch the gravitonometric generator back on. I hope no birds got in there...

What was that? Did you see a rhynoc? I thought I saw a rhynoc! Oooooh, take it from me, Spyro, never spend a week in a cage.  Uh, huh, next thing you know your whole island will be knee deep in rhynocs. Well, gotta go, Mr. Laser Blaster and I have a whole lotta work to do.

Ooooooh weeee, I love the sizzle of a high energy laser on the back end of a rhynoc. Too bad the Sorceress didn't send more of 'em, I was really getting into the zone. Well, now that my island is safe again I guess I'll have to go rhynoc hunting elsewhere... Are you headed out? &Leave the level? &Yes &No

See ya later, alligator!

I'm just going to patrol the island one last time...

Hiya, Spyro... I'm just off to patrol the island again, you know, in case any rhynocs decided to come crawling back...

I still haven't finished clearing the rhynocs off the island... &Level not finished... &Do you really want to leave? &Yes &No

I'll be back when I've wiped out the last of the rhynoc menace!
