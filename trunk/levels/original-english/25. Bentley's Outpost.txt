walk against object

I will gladly help you on your quest, Spyro, but first I must attend to my young sibling. I'm afraid he may have gotten himself into trouble during my absence.

It's good to know that Bartholomew is out of harm's way. &Leave the level? &Yes. &No.

I will sojourn amongst the worlds and if I find any eggs I'll do my utmost to recover them for you.

Ah well, I must return to my humble abode, for the time being.

I'm afraid I still have to attend to the safety of young Bartholomew. &Level not finished... &Do you really want to leave? &Yes. &No.

Well I'd love to leave with you but I still have to look after Bartholomew.

I'm afraid my home is still infested with rhynocs, I'll return when they are dealt with.

Bartholomew

Hey bro! It'd be really cool if you smashed that boulder. A swift smack should do the trick.

C'mon, c'mon just press the { button to swing your club. I wanna see it break into a million pieces.

I heard those big bullies calling you a wuss. You're not going to let them get away with that are you?

If you use your spin move to deflect the snowball into the gong I bet we can make the roof cave in.

We have to get the timing just right. Press the > button to spin your club when I throw a snowball.

It took me forever to train those seals to throw snowballs. Now they've gone and turned on me!

Oh no, another seal, and this one looks really mean.

Another gong, great. I bet we can cause an avalanche with this one!

A stinkin' rhynoc has blocked the way with this box. It shouldn't be any problem for you to push it out of the way though.

Pushing that block is easy for a big guy like you. Just stand next to the block and push forward on the directional button.

Hey brainiac, you're supposed to be smart. Why don't you try pushing those blocks around to bridge that gap?

Thanks bro! Here's a little something for your rock collection.

Hey you're in the way. Move it!
