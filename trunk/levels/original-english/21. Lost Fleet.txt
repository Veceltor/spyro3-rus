Be careful, roun' dese parts, li'l dragon! Dere be more ghosts in dis here shipyard den I kin shake me pick at! Durned shame, too, 'cause I was mighty close tuh findin' me treasure.

I reckon me treasure be thisaway... But we'll hafta blast through this bloomin' ship tuh git to it!

'Nother dad burned ship in the way o' me treasure... Wouldja mind blastin' this one too?

Wouldja lookit that! Some fool hid a dang gum egg in me treasure.

Dese here waters used to be my favorite divin' spot, but I can't get any loot with dese subs patrollin' around. Think you kin pilot dis here sub I bought for scrap? &Ride the sub? &Yes. &No.

Alrighty then. Press the < button to speed on up, and when you get a sub in your sights, the torpedo will start to lock on. If you get a good lock-on, fire away with the { button. &[Press < to speed up. &[Wait for red circles to lock on. &[Fire with { button!

Ah, dad gum, I gis I'll hafta git it workin' muhself.

Well, I'll be durned! You've got some mean sub-drivin' skills. Why don't you 'ave dis here egg as a re-ward.

Hoooohoooo, at last, the acid lake is safe fer swimmin' agin'! I wish I could re-ward ya better, but all I gots left is dis 'ere other egg. Maybe dere'll be something better in dis one.

Well, I hate t' ask yer help again, but dere be even more subs that durn come outta nowheres. If you could blast 'em, I could use dis acid lake as muh swimmin' hole again. &Blast some more subs? &Yes. &No.

Darn tootin'! Git on little dragon! &[Press < to speed up. &[Wait for red circles to lock on. &[Fire with { button!

Well, come back whenevers y' like.

Ya kin ride the sub just for fun, if ya like. &Ride the sub for cheap thrills? &Yes. &No.

Okey Dokey, take good care of 'er, y' here?

Well, come back whenevers y' like.

Awwwww, poor wittle dragon... did your friend go bye-bye? Now, now, don't worry... you'll soon be JOINING HIM!     -The Sorceress

Spyro, you're just in time! A rhynoc skateboard gang has challenged us to a race. They said you're slower than a Molten Crater fire slug. I stuck up for you, though! I told them I've seen some pretty fast fire slugs.

So, are you ready to race these guys? They bet us an egg that you won't win! &Race the rhynocs? &Bring 'em on! &Some other time...

Right on! You can use my special racing board. Every time you do a trick, it builds up turbo charge. You can use your turbos at any time by pressing the > button. Good luck! &[Do tricks to get turbos. &[Use turbos by pressing the > button. &[Beat all rhynocs in 3 lap race.

Awww, shucks... I thought you'd want to race 'em. Well, just come talk to me if you change your mind.

Sheesh, what happened? I could beat these guys with my tail tied behind my back! I hope you do better this time, or we'll never live it down... &Race the rhynocs? &Bring 'em on! &Some other time...

Alright! Let 'em have it! &[Do tricks to get turbos. &[Use turbos by pressing the > button. &[Beat all rhynocs in 3 lap race.

Awww, shucks... I thought you'd want to race 'em. Well, just come talk to me if you change your mind.

Yeeesss!! You schooled 'em like a bunch of dizzy, one-toed sand gnorcs! ... Oh yeah, I guess we won this egg, too.

Now that the rhynocs are gone, do you want to try a real challenge? I know you're fast, but I bet you can't defeat all the crabs on the course and still beat me in a race! Want to give it a shot? &Accept Hunter's challenge? &You're on, pal! &No dice...

Alright! Eat my skate-dust, sucker! &[Defeat all crabs on the course &[Beat Hunter in 3 lap race

Heh heh, what's the matter, getting chicken on me? Bwaaak bwaaak bwaaaaaak! Bwak bwaak bwak bwak bwaaaaaaaaaak!

So, are you ready to take my challenge? &Accept Hunter's challenge? &You're on, pal! &No dice...

Alright! Eat my skate-dust, sucker! &[Defeat all crabs on the course &[Beat Hunter in 3 lap race

Heh heh, you're just chicken aren't you? Bwaaak bwaaak bwaaaaaak! Bwak bwaak bwak bwak bwaaaaaaaaaak!

OK, you beat me Spyro, but you didn't get all the crabs. A dragon of your pedigree should really be able to do both!

Woooohooo! I'm still the speed king of the world!

Sheesh, I can't believe you beat me! You must have been practicing the whole time I thought you were looking for eggs... Hey, speaking of which, one of those crabs was guarding this one...

You might be able to beat me at skateboarding, but I still get all the chicks.
