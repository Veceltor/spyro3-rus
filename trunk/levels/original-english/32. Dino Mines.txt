Dear pest, go home and the monkey walks. In the meantime, this office is CLOSED.\      - The Sorceress.

Sorry, can't be here now. Gotta shoot some rhynocs.\         -Agent 9

Come on in, it's laser time!\        -Agent 9

Sheriff Wyatt

Well, gosh darn it Spyro. I came in here to check on my prisoner only to find out he'd somehow got away again. Then, when I came in to look around for clues, one o' them rowdy dinosaurs went and locked me in. Now they're out there causin' all sorts o' trouble and there's not a thing I can do about it.

Well I'll be, so that's how my prisoners keep escaping! Here take this dinosaur egg away before it hatches and causes more trouble. I think it must have been the runt of the litter though.

Jumpin' jehosephat, that's the cutest lookin' dinosaur I ever did see.

Deputy Holiday

One of them dinosaurs threw an egg down this flooded mine shaft. I'd get it back for you, but I ain't such a strong swimmer.

That was some mighty fine swimmin', young dragon.

It's mighty dangerous down there. You oughta watch out you don't get hurt.

Deputy Roy

If you'd just calm down for a second and stop all that whoopin' and hollerin' I could tell you what's goin on. The Bailey gang are holed up in them buildings over there. You're gonna have to go in there an' flush 'em out. &Take on the Bailey gang? &Darn tootin'. &No Sir.

&Well good luck to ya'.

Well, I'll just try to hold 'em off until some more help arrives.

Back again? Well, the Bailey gang is still hidin' out. Ya' ready to take 'em on? &Take on the Bailey gang? &Yessiree'. &Nope.

That darn Bailey gang! &Try again? &Yessiree. &Nope.

I don't know why the Bailey gang was trying so hard to steal this egg, that's not like them at all. I reckon someone must have put them up to it.

The sheriff promised me I could be a deputy. So I'm off to help clear out all the dinosaurs.
