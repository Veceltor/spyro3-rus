Remember, to get your longest glide press the < button at the very top of your jump, and use the } button to hover at the end of your jump.
The metal armor those enemies are wearing protects them from your dragon flame. If you hold down the > button, you can defeat them with your charge attack.
The rhynocs have shut down our cloud generator and I'll never see a rainbow again.
You'd think the Sorceress would want more rain, after what the sun has done to her skin.
If my wings were big and strong like yours, I could easily glide across here. &[Press < button to jump. &[Then press < button in midair to glide.
Oh, you activated the bellows? Maybe I can get the cloud generator working again...
The rhynocs must have been using this thing to clog up the cloud generator.
Well, well, if it isn't my favorite dragon! The Sorceress has put me in charge of guarding these bellows. However, I suppose I might look the other way if I was distracted by counting gems. &Pay ^^^ gems to activate bellows? &Sure, whatever. &No way, you doofus.
Oooooh yes... precious, precious gems... Well then, Spyro, you may now use the bellows any time you wish. Best of luck on your little egg hunt.
What? NO? What else are you going to do with all those gems? Buy flying lessons? (Heh heh) that was a good one...
Sorry, Spyro, it is my sworn duty to make certain no one crosses these bellows. And you know perfectly well that nothing could ever sway me from obeying my sworn duty... that is, ahem, until you have a few more gems. &[Activating bellows costs ^^^ gems.
Heh heh... I haven't made such easy money since the Sorceress bought that mayonaisse for sunscreen.



Our sun has gone out. We can make a new one with our lava fusion cauldron and three sun seeds, but they keep burning out before we can get them in the pot.
Step on the switch to get a fresh sun seed and keep flaming it until you get it into the pot.
Now that's what I call a sun! Here, you can have this last sun seed as a souvenir. I think it might be a dud, though.
If you can't keep up with the sun seed, remember you can always hold down the > button to charge. &[Press and hold > button to charge forward quickly.

We usually wake up our rain cloud at the crack of dawn, but these mischievous spirits are stopping our bells from ringing. &[Use the superfly powerup to flame the spirits in the belltowers.
Do you want this doodad? It fell out of the belfry.
