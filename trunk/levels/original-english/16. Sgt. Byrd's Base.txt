Sir! The situation is this, yesterday at 1845 hours the rhynocs invaded. We defended as best we could, sir, but without your leadership we didn't put up an effective resistance. By 1900 hours the rest of the squad was captured and the rhynocs had complete control of the base.

Recommend you take the enemy out with your rockets by pressing the { button, sir!

One carefully placed rocket blast should take this door down, sir.

Sir! I've captured the enemy rations. They won't march far on an empty stomach.

Sir! The rhynocs have blocked the way out of this next cave with a security door, and I don't think you'll be able to blast your way through this one. Recommend you land on the weights and carry them to the pressure sensitive security switches either side of the door. When in position press the > button to drop the weight. Press the } button once to look down, press it again to look up, sir! &[Land on item to pick it up. &[The > button drops item. &[Use the } button to change views.

Keep fighting the good fight sir! We're almost there, and I'm, uh, right behind you...

Mission accomplished. It's great to have you back, sir.

Sir! We need to rescue the rest of the squad before we can launch a raid on the Sorceress's castle.

Awaiting orders, sir.

I have to train the hummingbirds. They must be in peak physical condition if we're going to take on the Sorceress.

Don't worry I'll have the hummingbirds whipped into shape in no time. &Leave the level? &Yes &No

Tally ho, Spyro, I'm sure I'll see you around!

Any time you wanna leave just say so.

Don't worry I'll have the hummingbirds whipped into shape in no time. &Level not finished... &Do you really want to leave? &Yes &No
