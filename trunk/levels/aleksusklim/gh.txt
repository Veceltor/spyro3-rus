<guy>Sparx</guy></text>
<text><str>1021</str>
<en>Ok, you're going to race the butterflies. You have to fly through ALL of the green checkpoint rings in order. The red dots will lead the way. &[Fly through all green rings &[Use the red dots to guide you.</en>

<guy>Sparx</guy></text>
<text><str>105</str>
<en>You won't win the race without using the blue turbo stars. Try to use as many as possible, even if it means leaving the red dots, but remember to fly though the rings or you'll be disqualified. &[Use the blue turbo stars. &[Fly through all green rings</en>

<en>Hey Spyro, you don't have to follow the red dots exactly... you can take short cuts between rings. Heres an extra hint, if you fly lower you'll get a little more speed. &[Cut corners between the green rings. &[Flying lower gives you extra speed.</en>

<text><str>82</str>
<en>Now that was a 900! I have to admit, you've got some skills, Spyro. But before you get too cocky, let's see if you can score some real points on the giant ski ramp.

<en>Which challenge would you like to play? &Choose a challenge: &Time Attack &Race the Bi-planes &Quit</en>
<guy>Sparx</guy></text>
<text><str>142</str>
<en>Here's a hint. Try completing each challenge in order. Start with the rings, then get all the tractors, the cows, and save the planes for last. It's not the fastest way, but it is the easiest.</en>
<guy>Sparx</guy></text>
<text><str>190</str>
<en>Well the flying pigs are raring to go, let's get started. You have to fly through ALL of the green checkpoint rings in order. The red dots will lead the way. &[Fly through all green rings. &[Use the red dots to guide you.</en>
<guy>Sparx</guy></text>
<text><str>1065</str>

<text><str>396</str>
<en>Aaah, so you're trying for a best time are you? Well good luck.</en>
<guy>Sparx</guy></text>
<text><str>1000</str>
<en>You won't win the race without using the blue turbo stars. Try to use as many as possible, even if it means leaving the red dots, but remember to fly though the rings or you'll be disqualified. &[Use the blue turbo stars. &[Fly through all green rings</en>
<guy>Sparx</guy></text>
<text><str>163</str>
<en>Hey Spyro, you don't have to follow the red dots exactly so you can take short cuts between rings. Heres an extra hint, if you fly lower you'll get a little more speed. &[Cut corners between the green rings. &[Flying lower gives you extra speed.</en>

<en>A vast number of rhynocs are waiting to ambush us as soon as I lower this force field. I expect they'll keep coming until you shoot the red panic button next to the door where they come out. &[Shoot the red panic button to lock the rhynocs in.</en>

<en>There's another door at the end of this beach, and rhynocs will keep coming out until you shoot the red panic button.
