[249]	Spyro, I've found an egg, but only Sparx will be able to reach it. There's a small hole that leads to a crawdad farm. I can take him there if he's ready. &Enter Crawdad Farm bonus world? &Yes. &No.
[403]	Sparx has already recovered the egg from the crawdad farm, but he can go back if he wants to practice. &Return to Crawdad Farm bonus world? &Yes. &No.
[127]	Nice work Sparx! You've beaten the Crawdad King and found the lost egg. Not only that but some of the dragon magic seems to have rubbed off on you. Now you can pick up gems when they're even further away from Spyro.
[0]	Yes.
[0]	No.

[291]	Your game camera is currently in 'Passive' mode. This mode requires you to control the camera yourself, and moves more slowly.
[321]	If you like, I can change the game camera to 'Active' mode. In 'Active' mode, the camera moves much faster. &Change game camera to 'Active' mode?&No.&Yes.
[1174]	OK, I won't change it.
[252]	Your camera is now in 'Active' mode, and will move faster. If you don't like it, come back and see me, or change it yourself by using the Options Menu.
[1103]	Do you like the 'Active' camera mode? If not, I can set it back to the 'Passive' mode. &Change game camera to 'Passive' mode?&No.&Yes.
[330]	OK, I won't change it. Remember, you can change the camera mode yourself by using the Options Menu.
[402]	The game camera is now in 'Passive' mode. If you want me to change it again, just ask!

[134]	I'm sorry, Spyro, but you seem to be playing a hacked version of this game. This may be an illegal copy. Since this copy has been modified, you may experience problems that would not occur on a legal copy.

[106]	Hi Spyro. To look left or right, press the @4L2@0 or @4R2@0 buttons. To quickly center the camera behind you, press the @4L1@0 or @4R1@0 button. You can look all around by holding the } button down. &[Use @0L2@4 and @0R2@4 buttons to rotate camera. &[Press @0L1@4 or @0R1@4 to center the camera. &[Hold } to look around.

[290]	This is a superfly powerup Spyro. Whenever you walk through any powerup that looks like this one, it will allow you to fly for a while...

[1030]	I want to repay you for saving me from that octopus. We can help you use this hot air balloon, if you just bring back someone from each of the other worlds.
[561]	Let's head on over to the balloon!
[1161]	The balloon's all ready, sir! Just jump on!
[167]	Here I was, about to go for a nice swim at Shell Beach, and my portal just disappeared right in front of me. If you go find some more of those dragon eggs, I bet this portal would turn on again. &[^^ eggs needed to open portal.
[453]	Yay, my portal is working! I'll see you at the beach!
[237]	I think something is draining the magic out of the world. They say things have been going downhill ever since the dragons left here a thousand years ago.

[80]	I see an egg at the bottom of this lake. I would go get it, but I don't want to get my fur all wet. Maybe you could get it. You can dive underwater by pressing the > button when you're on the surface, and charge underwater by holding down the > button. &[Press > button to dive underwater &[Press < button to swim &[Hold down > button to charge underwater
[263]	Remember, press the > button to dive underwater. Then, when you are under the surface, hold down the > button to charge. &[Press > button to dive underwater &[Press < button to swim &[Hold down > button to charge underwater

[328]	If you can bring back one person from each of our five worlds, we can help you use the balloon.
[551]	Let's head on over to the balloon.
[351]	This balloon will take you to the great Tiki Lodge in the sky! Just jump on when you're ready.
[1013]	I'm late for a dinner party at the Tiki Lodge, and the portal to my home just stopped working. Maybe the portal will reactivate after a few more dragons hatch. &[^^ eggs needed to open portal.
[362]	At last, my portal is working again! Come visit me at the Tiki Lodge!

  (Cumulus)
[264]	This is a balloon that will take you to a new land, but we can't use it until you bring back one person from each of the five worlds.
[552]	Let's head on over to the balloon!
[530]	Hop in the balloon whenever you want, Spyro!

  (Mayor Leo)
[313]	I don't know how this balloon works, but I think we can get it working for you if you bring back someone from each of the other worlds.
[1173]	Let's head on over to the balloon!
[1044]	I guess you just hop in the balloon, now... Don't ask me how it works, I just showed up for the punch and cookies, a ha ha ha.

  (Bianca)
[37]	So... you're the one in charge of rescuing the eggs, huh? Heh heh heh... How sad... Look here, dragon, if you know what's good for you, you'll turn around and crawl back up that hole you came through. Those eggs belong to us now, and I've hidden them in places you'll never find in a thousand years! Besides, even if you could find an egg, our expertly trained armies will dispose of you and take it back. Do I make myself clear? If I find you here again, I am going to be verrrrry angry... and you won't like me when I'm angry...

[0]	Spyro, I've got a special task for Sparx. Meet me back here later!           -Zoe

  (Moneybags)
[71]	I'm getting paid a fortune to keep Sheila the Kangaroo locked up... heh heh... the pesky animal must have been causing a lot of trouble for that poor Sorceress... I suppose I could accidentally let the kangaroo escape... if you were to pay me, say...a small fee. &Pay ^^^ gems to free Sheila? &Sure. &No thanks.
[182]	Ahhh, Spyro, I love your sweet naivete... Your kind-hearted nature might be your downfall someday, but for the time being it's making me rich!
[220]	Well, don't worry, Spyro. Sheila won't stay in jail forever... The Sorceress is thinking about having her executed next Thursday.
[181]	The Sorceress has asked me to guard Sheila the Kangaroo. I suppose, if you had a bit more money, I'd be willing to let her escape. Then you could keep her for a pet or something. &[^^^ gems needed to free Sheila.
[0]	...
[43]	Spyro! My my, how funny to see you here! Why, I haven't seen you since we defeated Ripto in Avalar... heh heh... Well, my business went into a slump after you left, so I came here and struck up a nice deal with the local Sorceress. Lovely woman, she is. Seems to be very fond of dragons, too...

[94]	Yo, Spyro! I just found one of those portal thingamajigs that leads to a different world, but you'll have to glide to get across to it. Press the < button to jump, then press the < button again while you're in the air to glide! Just follow me... &[Press < button to jump. &[Press < button in mid-air to glide.
[478]	To get the best glide, press the < button at the very top of your jump.
[1014]	I saw something shiny in that cave over there...let's go check it out! You can get there by hovering. To hover, just press the } button at the end of your glide! &[Press the } button at the end of your glide to hover. &[Hovering will give you extra height and distance.
[166]	To get the best glide distance, press the < button while walking forward, then press it again at the top of your jump. Finally, press the } button just before you get to the landing to hover. &[Pressing the } button gives you extra glide distance!
[498]	Oh, I almost forgot, I found this egg!
[183]	There's definitely something shiny at the bottom of this hole. I was about to jump down there, but I think I hear running water and I hate to get wet. It's a cat thing.

  (Sheila the Kangaroo)
[327]	Hi, Spyro. If you bring someone back from each of the five worlds, we'll have enough weight to pull down this balloon for you.
[566]	Let's head on over to the balloon!
[360]	This balloon will take you to a land closer to the Sorceress, Spyro. You can also use it to come back here whenever you want to.

[1141]	Thanks for freeing me. Why don't you come visit me in my home world?
