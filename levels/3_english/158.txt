158: Haunted Tomb

  (Dan)
[54]	Ahhh, yet another dare-devil adventurer has come to rob our catacombs of loot! Let's just hope you're made of tougher stuff than the last guy... If you can survive the trials of our catacombs and answer my riddle, we will give you a prize befitting your efforts.
[130]	Here is my riddle:\ I am a vessel without hinges, lock or lid,\ yet, within my walls, a golden treasure is hid.\ What am I?
[1045]	Don't try to answer the riddle now. You'll need to save your breath to survive the trials of the catacombs.

[0]	GET LOST, DRAGON! There is no 'Agent 9'. Take your conspiracy theories and go back where you came from!\      -The Sorceress
[0]	Lab's full o' rhynocs... gotta help professor...\        -Agent 9
[0]	Come on in, it's laser time!\        -Agent 9

[1017]	I see you've managed to survive the trials of the catacombs. Now let's find out if your wits are as quick as your feet. Do you remember the riddle?
[209]	I am a vessel without hinges, lock or lid,\ yet, within my walls, a golden treasure is hid.\ What am I? &A bone &An egg &A treasure chest &A bandicoot
[1003]	Hmmmm... have you heard that one before? I never thought you'd get it. Very well, a bargain is a bargain. You may have the dragon egg that I was guarding from the Sorceress.
[316]	Sorry, dragon, that's completely wrong. You can try again, but you'll never get it by merely guessing.
[216]	I've waited seven thousand years for someone to solve that riddle... Now I can finally head off to Seashell Shore to bury some bones!

[171]	The first round of the annual demolition hovercraft competition is about to begin! There is room for one more contestant, but you'll have to answer a riddle to qualify.
[175]	The riddle is this:\ If one dragon can lay one egg in twelve years, how long would it take for 100 dragons to lay 100 eggs? &The answer: &1200 years &100 years &twelve years &1 year
[331]	Very impressive! That is correct. Good luck in the demolition hovercraft competition. &[Use the { button for a straight shot &[Use the > button for a lob shot &[Use @0L1@4 and @0R1@4 to dodge left and right.
[128]	Oooh, I am terribly sorry, but that is incorrect. Unless you can solve the riddle, we cannot trust you behind the controls of something so dangerous as a fully loaded demolition hovercraft.
[109]	That was indeed a battle for the ages! You're the first dragon to win the competition in over a thousand years. I proudly present you this year's grand prize...
[230]	Well, well, that was a fierce battle indeed... Please accept this prize for winning the first round...
[124]	You may now enter the championship round... However, this is an exceedingly dangerous sport. Might I suggest you quit while you're still in one piece? &Enter the final round? &Bring it on! &I'm outta here.
[229]	My my, such a brave reptile you are... but you'll need much more than bravery to win the championship... &[Use the { button for a straight shot &[Use the > button for a lob shot &[Use @0L1@4 and @0R1@4 to dodge left and right.
[1127]	Very well, then. I will reserve your spot in case you change your mind.

[68]	Behind this door lie the five deadly trials of King Rover. No one has ever survived all five. In fact, it is so dangerous that I cannot let you through this first door unless you are able to solve my riddle...
[222]	Here's the riddle:\ I follow you wherever you go,\ but the more of me you take,\ the more you leave behind.\ &What am I? &a shadow &time &a giant lizard &footsteps
[254]	My my, you're quite clever for someone with so little fashion sense... You may proceed to the first trial.
[226]	I'm sorry, my simian friend, but that was not even close. Perhaps you would prefer to go play with a nice bouncy ball.

[69]	One of those dogs with the funny hats put a curse on me, just 'cause I shot him in the butt a couple times. He said he turned my tail into a snake. Does it look like a snake to you? It does feel kinda funny, come to think of it. Hoo boy, that dog's gonna pay!
