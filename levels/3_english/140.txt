[104]	Oh hewwo, it's good to see you again, Spywo. That naughty sorcewess has stolen the pwofessor's wocket plans and I'm on a secwet mission to find them. Handel was supposed to meet me here but I can't find him anywhere. Maybe you could help?
[243]	It looks like you'll have to use this cannon to get across here, simply climb aboard. As for me I just have to fwee my mind...
[326]	It looks like the sorcewess has already used the plans to build her own wocket. We have to destwoy it. Just follow me.
[1061]	Hey, look what was in the wocket. They must have been twying to put it into orbit.
[1081]	If you see Handel tell him I've gone back to Evening Lake to finish work on the pwofessor's wocket.

[235]	Uh oh. You'll have to use this combo powerup to take out these fire dwagons. It will allow you to superfwy and superfwame at the same time. &[Defeat the two flying fire dragons &[The fire dragons will grow back their tails when left alone.
[1109]	Here have this. I fished it out of the molten wava.
[344]	You can't afford to waste any time Spywo. If you leave the fire dwagons alone their tails will gwo back.
[528]	I knew those monsters would be no match for you.

[1020]	Hey Spyro, I'm helping a kid called Handel recover some secret rocket plans the Sorceress stole. You know I'm always ready to kick some rhynoc booty.

  (Handel)
[107]	Hi, Agent 9! Behind those doors are some pwetty scary ninjas! I bet you could use your sharp shooter skills to take them out. Wemember, pwess the { button to shoot and use @4L1@0 and @4R1@0 to dodge left and wight. &[Defeat the ninjas to find the baby dragon egg. &[Press the } button to enter sniper mode &[Use @0L1@4 and @0R1@4 to zoom in and out while in sniper mode
[359]	Thanks for wescuing me, you'd better look after this egg before the whynocs twy to blow that up too.
[438]	Thanks for helping me Agent 9. Those whynocs never knew what hit them.

  (Handel)
[285]	I think I can see an egg behind you, but it's out of weach. You'll have to take the long way wound through all these whynocs to get to it.
[1152]	Watch out for that wava, it looks super hot.
