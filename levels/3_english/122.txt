122: Spooky Swamp

  (Homer the Firefly)
[429]	\           That gator was mean.\          I thought I was a goner.\           Thanks for saving me.
[393]	Our tea lamps are dark.\         Perhaps your hot dragon breath\           could set them aglow.
[376]	No happier sight\         Have I seen, than a tea lamp\           lit by Dragonflame.
[424]	\           Beware the water.\         Snapping jaws of piranha\           claim many victims.

  (Shiny the Firefly)
[1060]	\           You are brave, dragon.\         Much braver than I, by far.\          Here, take this darn egg.

  (Bubba the Firefly)
[445]	\           When all lamps are lit\          there is a secret in here\            that I will show you.
[433]	\           The tea lamps are lit!\         Now I'll tell you the secret\           of what's in this house!
[425]	\           A creepy wizard\    lives inside, but hates the light.\           He has awoken.
[408]	\           He swore to destroy\        whoever lights the tea lamps.\           Better you than me. &[Use Wizard's bombs against him. &[Avoid Gators.

  (Moneybags)
[1071]	\           This door is jammed shut.\            Only the power of gems\             Can hope to move it. &Pay ^^^ gems to open the door? &Sure, just shut up. &No, your haiku poetry stinks.
[136]	\           You've made a wise choice...\        It will mean more eggs for you...\              And more gems for me. \           Best of all, Spyro...\        I can stop speaking Haiku.\           What a sweet relief!
[1068]	\           Dad gummit, dragon.\      Just cough up those stinking gems.\           And I can go home.
[341]	\           I can't let you through.\       You're too poor to pass this door.\           Come back with more cash. &[^^^ gems needed to open door
[363]	\           Stop talking to me.\         I hate speaking in Haiku.\           Just go find some gems...

[364]	\           This swamp smells so sweet.\        The springtime trees are fragrant.\            I'm off to kick butt.

  (Basho the Firefly)
[153]	\           We have the bombs here.\         We must destroy the egg cage.\             But we just go boom.\ \           Kangaroo can help!\        You can clear the path for us!\           Will Sheila help us? &Help the firefly bombers? &Yes, I love your freestyle Haiku. &Sorry, just passing through.
[427]	\          If you clear my path\       I can blow up the egg cage.\         Poor, poor captive eggs. &Help the twin? &Yes, of course. &No more Haiku... please!
[324]	\           The eggs are all free!\          Two dragons are born today!\              Sheila's my hero.
[1078]	\           Yes! It's bombing time!\         Here I come, my little eggs,\           To free you at last!!
[1105]	\           We will be waiting.\        When you return to help us,\           We shall bomb again!
[1086]	\           One egg cage remains.\        Will you now help my brother\           to free the last egg? &Will you help my brother now? &Yes.&No.
[283]	OW...\           I went boom again.\    Big rocks can be kicked, they say,\        Mushrooms must be stomped. &Help the twin? &Yes.&No.
[394]	\           Yes! It's bombing time!\         Here I come, my little eggs,\           To free you at last!! &[Kick rocks out of the way. &[Stomp on mushrooms.
