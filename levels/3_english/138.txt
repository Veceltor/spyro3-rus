[172]	Dese here waters used to be my favorite divin' spot, but I can't get any loot with dese subs patrollin' around. Think you kin pilot dis here sub I bought for scrap? &Ride the sub? &Yes. &No.
[137]	Alrighty then. Press the < button to speed on up, and when you get a sub in your sights, the torpedo will start to lock on. If you get a good lock-on, fire away with the { button. &[Press < to speed up. &[Wait for red circles to lock on. &[Fire with { button!
[1129]	Ah, dad gum, I gis I'll hafta git it workin' muhself.
[273]	Well, I'll be durned! You've got some mean sub-drivin' skills. Why don't you 'ave dis here egg as a re-ward.
[108]	Hoooohoooo, at last, the acid lake is safe fer swimmin' agin'! I wish I could re-ward ya better, but all I gots left is dis 'ere other egg. Maybe dere'll be something better in dis one.
[147]	Well, I hate t' ask yer help again, but dere be even more subs that durn come outta nowheres. If you could blast 'em, I could use dis acid lake as muh swimmin' hole again. &Blast some more subs? &Yes. &No.
[529]	Darn tootin'! Git on little dragon! &[Press < to speed up. &[Wait for red circles to lock on. &[Fire with { button!
[548]	Well, come back whenevers y' like.
[1149]	Ya kin ride the sub just for fun, if ya like. &Ride the sub for cheap thrills? &Yes. &No.
[1146]	Okey Dokey, take good care of 'er, y' here?
[1175]	Well, come back whenevers y' like.

[89]	Spyro, you're just in time! A rhynoc skateboard gang has challenged us to a race. They said you're slower than a Molten Crater fire slug. I stuck up for you, though! I told them I've seen some pretty fast fire slugs.
[398]	So, are you ready to race these guys? They bet us an egg that you won't win! &Race the rhynocs? &Bring 'em on! &Some other time...
[125]	Right on! You can use my special racing board. Every time you do a trick, it builds up turbo charge. You can use your turbos at any time by pressing the > button. Good luck! &[Do tricks to get turbos. &[Use turbos by pressing the > button. &[Beat all rhynocs in 3 lap race.
[336]	Awww, shucks... I thought you'd want to race 'em. Well, just come talk to me if you change your mind.
[204]	Sheesh, what happened? I could beat these guys with my tail tied behind my back! I hope you do better this time, or we'll never live it down... &Race the rhynocs? &Bring 'em on! &Some other time...
[539]	Alright! Let 'em have it! &[Do tricks to get turbos. &[Use turbos by pressing the > button. &[Beat all rhynocs in 3 lap race.
[338]	Awww, shucks... I thought you'd want to race 'em. Well, just come talk to me if you change your mind.
[245]	Yeeesss!! You schooled 'em like a bunch of dizzy, one-toed sand gnorcs! ... Oh yeah, I guess we won this egg, too.
[120]	Now that the rhynocs are gone, do you want to try a real challenge? I know you're fast, but I bet you can't defeat all the crabs on the course and still beat me in a race! Want to give it a shot? &Accept Hunter's challenge? &You're on, pal! &No dice...
[1113]	Alright! Eat my skate-dust, sucker! &[Defeat all crabs on the course &[Beat Hunter in 3 lap race
[1039]	Heh heh, what's the matter, getting chicken on me? Bwaaak bwaaak bwaaaaaak! Bwak bwaak bwak bwak bwaaaaaaaaaak!
[482]	So, are you ready to take my challenge? &Accept Hunter's challenge? &You're on, pal! &No dice...
[457]	Alright! Eat my skate-dust, sucker! &[Defeat all crabs on the course &[Beat Hunter in 3 lap race
[1040]	Heh heh, you're just chicken aren't you? Bwaaak bwaaak bwaaaaaak! Bwak bwaak bwak bwak bwaaaaaaaaaak!
[266]	OK, you beat me Spyro, but you didn't get all the crabs. A dragon of your pedigree should really be able to do both!
[456]	Woooohooo! I'm still the speed king of the world!
[122]	Sheesh, I can't believe you beat me! You must have been practicing the whole time I thought you were looking for eggs... Hey, speaking of which, one of those crabs was guarding this one...
[370]	You might be able to beat me at skateboarding, but I still get all the chicks.
