[1052]	Whoooa! A bunch of sheep in flying saucers just came out of nowhere and started blasting up the race course!
[476]	Looks like I'll have to hop in my plane and teach 'em some manners! &Shoot down sheep UFOs? &Go for it! &Looks too dangerous...
[549]	Look out sheep, here I come! &[{ button to fire. &[< or > button for turbo.
[494]	Yeah, when sheep go hi-tech, you gotta watch out!
[1101]	Wooohooooo! Check it out, the squad leader had abducted this egg!

[1191]	Which challenge would you like to play? &Choose a challenge: &Time Attack &Race the Butterflies &Exit level
[144]	Here's a hint. Try completing each challenge in order. Start with the rings, then get all the dandelions, the spiders, and save the butterflies for last. It's not the fastest way, but it is the easiest.
[1021]	Ok, you're going to race the butterflies. You have to fly through ALL of the green checkpoint rings in order. The red dots will lead the way. &[Fly through all green rings &[Use the red dots to guide you.
[559]	Alright, we'll try again later.
[415]	The insects were so impressed with your flying skills they awarded you this egg.
[553]	Wow! You won first prize.
[91]	Now that you've completed the challenge, you could go for your best time. Try cutting corners and charging for extra speed. Also, remember that completing the challenge in order may not be the fastest way, try experimenting.
[105]	You won't win the race without using the blue turbo stars. Try to use as many as possible, even if it means leaving the red dots, but remember to fly though the rings or you'll be disqualified. &[Use the blue turbo stars. &[Fly through all green rings
[165]	Hey Spyro, you don't have to follow the red dots exactly... you can take short cuts between rings. Heres an extra hint, if you fly lower you'll get a little more speed. &[Cut corners between the green rings. &[Flying lower gives you extra speed.
[1012]	Hi Spyro! There are 2 flying challenges available here in Mushroom Speedway. You can either try Time Attack or Race the Butterflies.
