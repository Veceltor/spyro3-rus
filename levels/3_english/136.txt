136: Frozen Altars

  (Ernest)
[179]	Eustace and I were having a snowman building competition when the Sorceress brought them to life with a spell. Since then they've been stomping around building ice walls and generally causing trouble.
[1051]	What if you tried melting the snowman using the laser? I'd do it myself, but you know, the flippers.
[509]	I knew we should have bought the automated laser defense system.

  (Alex)
[1001]	Some bear sold us a laser defense system to protect us from Rhynocs, but with these flippers I can't even turn it on. You'd have no trouble using it though. Just walk inside. When you're done, press the } button and you'll walk back out.
[510]	Maybe you could use the laser to melt that ice block as well.
[508]	When I get my flippers on that rotten bear...

  (Gabrielle)
[234]	Welcome to Frozen Altars, Spyro! On behalf of the ice fairies, I want to grant you a special power for as long as you stay in our world.

[49]	Say, Spyro, you're a sports fan aren't you? As you probably know, Frozen Altars is the birthplace of the great sport of cat hockey. Today's match is sold out, of course, but I just happen to have a spare ticket that I'll sell you for... say... a teensy weensy markup... &Pay ^^^ gems to enter cat hockey rink? &Sure, I love cat hockey. &I'll pass.
[88]	Head on in, Spyro, it should be a thrilling match! In fact... heh heh.. I've even placed a little wager on the rhynoc team... let's just hope the local team doesn't have any last minute accidents...
[131]	Off you go, then... But you'll regret it... Many years from now you'll sit on your old dragon haunches and wish with all your might that you could have just one more chance to see a game of cat hockey...
[242]	You had better hurry up and find some cash, Spyro. Today's cat hockey match is about to start, and I can't let you in without a ticket. &[Entering cat hockey rink costs ^^^ gems.
[1043]	Heh heh... I hate to spoil the game for you, Spyro, but I've already bribed the local team to forfeit to the rhynocs.

  (Eustace)
[473]	It would be easy to get up to that treasure if you had something to stand on.
[274]	An ice block, yeah that's what you need to reach that treasure. Now how are we going to get one around here?
[377]	Brrr, I don't know why but I feel reaaalllly cold.

  (Eugene)
[261]	Thanks for helping out, Spyro. Why don't you take this. The rhynocs were trying to fry it with a laser, but you stopped them just in time.

[253]	Ahh, Spyro. I have just received word from my little brother, he appears to be having some trouble with a yeti.

  (Bartholomew)
[315]	That dumb yeti took my ball. I told him to give it back or you'd kick his lousy butt, but he wouldn't listen. &Fight yeti? &Yes. &No.
[1032]	I knew you'd do it. Go and show him not to mess with us. Remember to block his high punches, and hit him low when he tries to block. &[Use the > button for a quick jab. &[Use the < button for a body blow. &[Use the { button for the big hookaroo. &[Use the } button to block high. &[Bentley blocks low automatically.
[519]	But how will I get my ball back now?
[1072]	heh heh heh... You really showed him... Hey, wait a minute this isn't my ball!
[455]	You should go back and kick his butt again! Make him give me my ball back. &Fight yeti again? &Yes. &No.
[354]	This time it will be a 3 round match, and when you win, don't let him send you off with a stupid egg!
[265]	But.. but my ball bwaaaaa.
[1143]	Only two more rounds to go, you're doing great.
[542]	This is the last round, finish him off.
[419]	Hey!!! This isn't my ball, it's just another stupid egg!
[1058]	You lost? But how am I going to get my ball back? You've got to try again. &Try fighting yeti again? &Yes. &No.
[1057]	You lost! Oh, some brother you are. I'm never going to see my ball again, am I? &Try fighting yeti again? &Yes. &No.
[400]	Oh... I found my ball, I'd forgotten I lent it to Eugene yesterday. No harm done, right?

  (Errol)
[244]	I challenged a rhynoc to a traditional game of cat hockey, but I think I sprained my flipper during training. Would you mind taking my place? &Will you play cat hockey? &Yes. &No.
[472]	Great, freeze the cats and push them into my goal to score. &[Push frozen cats into the blue goal. &[First one with 5 cats wins.
[1108]	But if I can't find anyone to play for me I'll forfeit the championship.
[1122]	Don't waste time talking to me, he's gonna score.
[1110]	Well done, I think you deserve to keep the champion's cup.
[439]	You gave that rhynoc such a drubbing he's retired from the sport for good.
[1093]	You should ask for a rematch. I think that guy sprayed catnip in his goal. &Are you ready to play again? &Yes. &No.
[294]	That rhynoc has been gloating ever since he beat you, but I think it was just a fluke. You should ask for a rematch! &Are you ready to play again? &Yes. &No.
