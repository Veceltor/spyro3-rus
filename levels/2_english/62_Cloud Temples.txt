0-0] I used to be one of Avalar's most powerful magicians...until that big warlock over there stole my wand. He and his friends have used the magic to take over the city.
0-1] You don't actually expect ME to fight him, do you? You're the big tough dragon, right?
1-0] I'm a secret agent! I'm going to my secret hideout. Only members of my secret club are allowed to go there. I'm not leaving unless you hide behind that tree so you can't see me. &[Hide behind the tree.&[Follow Agent Zero.
1-1] What? You managed to get here without following me? You must be a member of my secret club after all! Here, take this secret decoder. It will allow us to send secret messages!
1-3] This time I'd better not catch you sneaking behind me...my hideout is for members only!
1-4] Heh heh... I'm too fast for anyone to follow. No one will ever find my hideout!
1-5] I'm not leaving unless you wait behind the tree. &[Wait behind the tree. &[Follow Agent Zero. &[Use trees to hide.
2-0] Our mystical bell towers have been overrun by trolls, and the bells haven't been rung in days! I tried a fire spell on the trolls but it just made them crazier.
2-1] This superfreeze powerup will chill out the trolls, but we really need the bells to ring. They'll ring if you charge into them! &[Freeze the trolls. &[Charge the bells to ring them.
2-2] Thanks Spyro! I didn't think you could do it. Here, have a souvenir from the Mystic City gift shop.
2-3] Our bell towers have been invaded by trolls! You might be able to help, but you can't beat them without activating this powerup...
2-4] I suppose you want an orb for doing that. Well I'm afraid not. There's still one bell left. You can get to it by using the whirlwind behind me.
6-0] Gee, I wish our bell towers were still working like they used to.
6-1] Spyro, you have freed our city from the claws of those evil warlocks. Please, take this orb, I foresee that it will help you on your journey.
6-2] Listen carefully Spyro, if you want to get back to your home world, hold that orb and recite these three words: Klaatu, Verata, Ni... Nuh... Naah... Nevermind.
