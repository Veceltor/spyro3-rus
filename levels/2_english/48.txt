1-1] Spyro, it's a good thing you're here. I've been trying to get a berry out of this magic berry bush, but I'm just not strong enough.
1-2] If you charge or flame the bush, one of those yummy berries should drop!
1-3] By eating the berries we become big and strong...
1-4] I guess you'll have to glide across to this berry bush.
1-5] Keep getting the berries for me and I'll take you to the Great Berry Bush!
1-6] You'll have to go back to those steps you passed to reach this one.
1-7] Hitting the bush with one of those lava rocks should work...
1-8] I think I passed some lava rocks in the the last room.
1-9] Thanks for helping me reach the Great Berry Bush. Now we can eat berries all the time! Here take this. It's a gift from all of us Hippos.

2-2] Good job! Now there are two thieves left. Let me show you where they are...
2-3] Excellent! Let me show you where the last thief is...
2-4] Thanks for bringing back the three magic lamps. Here, take this orb. Some fairy left it with me, but it won't hold a proper shine.

3-2] Thanks for freeing us. All I have to give you is this thingy I found...at least it's not a rock.
3-3] I have a big family, but you've managed to save all of them! Take this thing too...I'm too tired to carry it anymore.
3-4] Spyro, my brothers have been trapped in solid rock...I'm afraid you'll need to learn some kind of @4headbash@0 move before you can help us...
3-5] It's great you've learned to headbash Spyro, but I'm afraid neither of us can cross this lava until that powerup is working...
3-6] Almost successful, Spyro. &Are you ready to try again? &Yes&No
