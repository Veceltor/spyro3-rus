1-1] Well, well, I bet a rich dragon like you wouldn't mind cashing in a few gems to learn how to @4climb@0! I'd be willing to teach you for, say, I don't know... a small fee. &Pay ^^^ gems to learn how to climb?&Yes Please&No Thanks
1-2] You won't regret it! OK, when you see a wall surface that looks climbable, like the one to my left here, just @4jump onto it@0 and you will grab it with your claws.
1-3] OK, you can come back and learn later, but if you had any idea what was at the top of this wall, you'd be willing to pay double what I'm asking!
1-4] I'd like to teach you how to @4climb@0, Spyro, but you seem to have squandered all your gems on knick-knacks and junk food. Come see me when you have more gems, and I'll teach you about climbing. &[Learning to climb costs ^^^ gems.
1-5] Remember, when you see a wall that looks climbable, just jump onto it!
1-6] Use the D-pad to move up and down, and press jump again to get off. You can also jump sideways onto another climbable area.
2-1] There's a secret whirlwind here that will only appear when you have at least @4six@0 orbs.
2-2] Well done, Spyro. The power from your orbs has activated the whirlwind.
2-3] Ripto keeps on taking over our castles. At this rate, moving doesn't sound like a bad idea...
2-4] Would you like me to take you to a world where you can find a new talisman? &Go to new portal?&Yes&No
2-5] Great! I'll take you to a new portal!
2-6] OK, come find me if you ever need help finding a world where you haven't got the talisman.
3-1] Legend has it that there is a portal to Zephyr here. And, legend also has it that I know how to activate it. Furthermore, as I recall, the legend mentions something about me activating it for... a small fee. &Pay ^^^ gems to get to Zephyr?&Sure&No Thanks
3-2] Thanks for the gems, Spyro! With all this cash, I can open a Lizard Burger shop in Skelos Badlands!
3-3] OK, you can come back and learn later, but if you had any idea how much treasure there is in Zephyr, you'd pay double what I'm asking!
3-4] Sorry, Spyro, if you weren't flat broke I'd activate this portal for you. Due to circumstances outside my control there is a one-time activation fee. &[Activating portal costs ^^^ gems.
3-5] Those darn birds in Zephyr never paid me for all the bombs and TNT barrels I gave them...
4-1] Hi, Spyro. Ripto and Gulp are hiding out in a room in the castle below us. You'll need @4all@0 @4fourteen@0 @4talismans@0 in order to break the lock and get to them.
4-2] Well done, Spyro. Now that you have all fourteen talismans, your guidebook can break the lock on the door and you can fight Gulp. Are you ready? &Fight Gulp now?&Bring him on!&Errr, maybe later.
4-3] You'll have to jump down the hole in the floor to get to where Ripto and Gulp are waiting. I can help you out a little bit. I tamed a few pterodactyls from Skelos Badlands...they'll be dropping objects that you can use to fight Gulp.
4-4] Would you like me to take you to a world where you can find a new talisman? &Go to new portal?&Yes&No
4-5] Great! I'll take you to a new portal!
4-6] OK, come find me if you ever need help finding a world where you haven't got the talisman.
4-7] OK, come back whenever you're ready.
5-1] I would love to let you enter this speedway free of charge, Spyro. Love to. Unfortunately, the speedway rules require me to charge a small fee. &Pay ^^^ gems to get access to the speedway?&It's a bargain!&No thanks
5-2] You've chosen wisely! I bet a quick dragon like you will win your money back in no time!
5-3] OK, come back when you want to do some racing.
5-4] Sorry, Spyro, but it looks like you don't have enough cash to activate this speedway portal. I bet you spent all your money on those flirtatious fauns in Fracture Hills. You always were a sucker for a pretty face. &[Activating portal costs ^^^ gems.
5-5] Good luck in the races, Spyro. I'm betting on you to win first place. Don't let me down!
6-1] I can let you into the little castle over there in exchange for a few gems. What do you say? &Pay ^^^ gems to get to the little castle?&Why not?&No Thanks.
6-2] No one's been through that portal in years. I thought I'd never find a sucker...er, I mean, you're a shrewd customer, Spyro!
6-3] OK, it's up to you. I hear there are lots of gems over there...really.
6-4] What? What happened to all your money? Now don't go blaming me, I've given you nothing but bargains! I'll let you cross the bridge when you have more gems. &[Access to portal costs ^^^ gems.
6-5] Have fun over there! Say 'hi' to Ripto if you see him.
7-1] Sorry Spyro, this door is stuck and it's going to take some orb energy to open it. Come back when you've got a few more orbs. &[^ orbs needed to open door.
7-2] Orbs are very powerful Spyro... collect a few now and you won't regret it later. There are at least two in every world of Avalar...
7-3] Oh, Spyro, hello. I was just having trouble with this door and I think some orb power might unstick it. I see you've collected a good number of orbs there! &[^ orbs open the door!
