1-1] Spyro, we want to help you fight Ripto! Elora is using the orbs you collected to store powerup energy. Hunter will throw the powered-up orbs to you as they become ready.  Even as we speak, the professor is experimenting with new forms of powerup energy, so you'll soon have abilities that no one has ever seen before!
