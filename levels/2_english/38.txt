11-1] Hello there, Spyro. I could arrange for you to cross this bridge for...ahem...a small fee. &Pay ^^^ gems to cross the bridge?&Yes Please&No Thanks
11-2] Thank you, Spyro! Now I can buy that condo in Hurricos that I've been wanting for so long. Go ahead across the bridge!
11-3] OK. I'll be here if you change your mind.
11-4] Sorry, Spyro, it looks like you can't afford to cross the bridge yet. Come back and see me when you have collected more treasure. &[Crossing bridge costs ^^^ gems.
11-5] Be careful on the other side of that bridge. I don't want anything bad to happen to my favorite customer.
12-1] This whole area is infested with creepy draclets. You might be able to help us get rid of them...if you could fly... &[Defeat 15 enemies to activate powerup.
12-2] We used to give guided tours of these caves, but now they are infested with multiplying draclets. It's only a matter of time before they take over our whole village. Do you think you can get rid of them for us? &Help eliminate the draclets? &Sure!&Looks too scary.
12-3] Great! But remember, you have to catch them all quickly because if any are left alive they will continue to multiply! &[Flame all draclets. &[Use the superfly powerup.
12-4] OK, I understand. It's a very tough job. Some of our bravest villagers have already been eaten.
12-5] You have saved us all from a grisly fate. Please accept this orb as a small token of our thanks...
12-6] I'll also make sure you get free snow cones whenever you visit us.
13-1] I lost my pet snow leopard. I was busy fishing, and when I turned around, he was gone. I hope George didn't get eaten by the draclets. &[Bring back the snow leopard.
13-2] You found George! I'm so glad he's safe. I'll be sure to pay more attention to him from now on. All I have with me is this round shiny thing I caught while I was fishing. You can have it if you like.
14-1] Ow! You'd think those guys could've got me out of here without rolling a two ton snowball onto my head. Here, take this crystal... I traded some hockey tickets for it.
