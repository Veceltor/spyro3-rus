1) «We need a vacation!»

Spyro: Is this rain ever gonna stop? I've forgotten what the sun looks like. We should go on vacation! Somewhere warm... somewhere sunny... Dragon Shores! Yeah! I haven't been there since we kicked Gnasty Gnorc's butt! How about it, Sparx? You up for a vacation at the beach? Last one there is a Gnorc!

2) «I've got a dragon!»

Elora: Is it working, Professor?
Professor: Almost... just a few more adjustments to these orbs and...
Hunter: Maybe this isn't such a good idea... bringing a dragon here could just make Ripto angrier!
Elora: Calm down, Hunter! And stop fidgeting!
Hunter: But you saw the Professor's book! They have claws like this, teeth like this, and they spit fire like THIS! They sound much more dangerous than Ripto!
Elora: That's exactly the point! A dragon is our only chance of stopping Ripto. And you know it!
Professor: It's working... IT'S WORKING! I've got a dragon!!
Spyro: Woah... rough landing! Hi! Which way's the... beach? Hey, stop staring! Haven't you guys ever seen a dragon before?
Hunter: You're a dragon?
Spyro: You got a problem with that, pussycat?
Ripto: Well, well... someone forgot to invite me to the party! Are you trying to keep something from me? A dragon?! You brought a dragon to Avalar?! I. Hate. DRAGONS! Ow! Crush, kill it, kill it! Gulp, you imbecile! You ate my scepter! I'll deal with you later!
Spyro: Who was that jerk?
Elora: That was Ripto! And we have to get rid of him! He's causing all sorts of trouble around here...but I haven't got time to explain. Here, take this magic guide to Avalar. It'll help you begin to understand our worlds. Right now, I have to follow Ripto and see what he's up to! I'll meet you in Summer Forest, okay?
Spyro: Hey, wait a minute! How do we get ourselves into these messes, pal?

3) «I'm a faun, you dork!»

Elora: Oh, no... Oh hello! We didn't get a chance to introduce ourselves before; my name is Elora.
Spyro: Uh, hi! I'm Spyro... What are you? Some kind of goat? 
Elora: I'm a faun, you dork!
Spyro: Oh! Sorry...
Elora: Did you meet the gemcutters in Glimmer?
Spyro: Yeah, they gave me a souvenir too! They called it a talisman.
Elora: They gave you a talisman?
Spyro: What, is it special? I just stuck it in the guidebook you gave me.
Elora: There are fourteen talismans in Avalar, and they are all magical! If you can collect enough of them, they can be used to defeat Ripto! Hunter! Where have you been?
Hunter: I, uh...got a little lost.
Elora: Spyro's going to help us collect the talismans!
Spyro: I am?
Hunter: He is?
Elora: Spyro, look...there's no way you can get to Dragon Shores right now. Ripto and his monsters have taken over the castle here in the Summer Forest. You're going to have to go to Avalar's worlds, and convince the inhabitants to give you their talisman. You can keep them in your guidebook.
Hunter: Hey, I can do that! Why doesn't the dragon just torch Ripto?
Elora: Hunter, you can't even keep track of your running shoes! How can we trust you with fourteen talismans? If you come across any orbs, they're important too... But I'll tell you about them later.
Spyro: Okay, no problem! I'll collect a few talismans, give Ripto the old hotfoot, and be in Dragon Shores by lunchtime!

4) «No dragons, wonderful!»

Elora: Before you get to the castle dungeon Spyro, I thought that you might want to know how Ripto and his monsters arrived in Avalar. You see, last week in the Winter Tundra, the Professor was working on some new super portal technology...
Professor: There, that's the last orb in place! Now let's see... all we need are some co-ordinates!
Hunter: How about...22-4-75? That's my birthday. 
Elora: No, Hunter! Don't!
Hunter: What?
Ripto:  Get off me! Get off me, you useless buffoons! Why can't either... of... you... Where are we? Hmm... No dragons. Wonderful! Crush, go back and pack my bags! We're moving in! Say hello to your new king.
Elora: Professor, shut it down! Hurry!
Professor: Oh my, oh my! I can't see the switch, I think I've broken my glasses!
Ripto: Crush! Go through the portal, you idiot!
Elora: Tell all your friends to take the orbs and scatter them throughout Avalar! Quickly! Ripto: Noo! Gulp! Crush! Get the orbs now! Ooh... you despicable little creature! I'll kill you!
Elora: This is bad news for Avalar. Hunter, why didn't you chase him?
Hunter: Uh... yeah, I um... would've gone after him... but didn't he say something about not liking dragons?
Elora: Professor, can we catch a dragon to help us?
Professor: Yes... yes, I think so! We'll need a world that has an alignment much better suited to intercepting one of these creatures... how about... Glimmer?
Elora: Good idea! We'd better go right now!

5) «Bring it on, shorty!»

Ripto: Noo! Crush! You may have been able to defeat that simpleton, but Gulp will be more than a match for you!
Spyro: Bring it on, Shorty!
Ripto: Gulp! Come here now! Destroy him, and make sure it's painful! What... the roof?! Gulp, get me out of here! So long, dragon!
Spyro: What a wuss!

6) «Boo…»

Moneybags: Hmph! That Ripto has caused enough damage! All his meddling has cost me a fortune. If it wasn't for Spyro, I'd be bankrupt! If Ripto were here, I'd give him a piece of my mind. In fact, I'd give him a lot more than that! I was a champion bantumweight boxer at University, and I still know a few moves... Take that! And that!
Ripto: Boo!
Moneybags: Why you... you...

7) «Gulp, lunch time!»

Ripto: Gulp, we've finally made Avalar ours! You've earned a special reward. Gulp? What is it, boy? Oh, the fairy. Here you go! You singed my cape! Dragon, you are really starting to get on my nerves! Say goodbye, flame-breath! Gulp, lunch time! Gulp, finish him off and you can have all the fairies you can eat! I'm going to enjoy this...!

8) «Spyro, you did it!»

Elora: Spyro, you did it!
Spyro: Woah! Elora, where'd you come from?
Elora: I was just outside the castle in Autumn Plains...the castle is now free again! There's no sign of Ripto! And since you've been around, the creatures of Avalar are finally starting to get along! Since you've done so much for Avalar, and since I know you've really missed being on vacation... we really wanted to do something nice for you. It's not much, but we hope you like it.
Spyro: Wow, this is great! Aren't you gonna join me?
Elora: Uh... no. I'd like to, but I've got to go check on the Professor in the Winter Tundra. He's still trying to fix the super portal so we can send you home.
Spyro:  Oh... that sounds interesting. I think I'll just hang out here for a while and soak up a few rays... Hey, where'd Elora go? I'd better follow her...

9) «You little fools!»

Professor: I think I've finally come up with a way to access the Dragon Worlds from the super portal! This power crystal should give us the extra boost that we need! Just a few more calculations to set it up... I think I have it... excellent! Everything is finally ready! We're going to need a lot more orbs, but with the power crystal boosting it, the super portal should work again.
Ripto: Soo... you thought you had gotten rid of me? Well, I'm afraid not! I persuaded that fat bear, Moneybags to sell me a few bombs.
Elora: Quick, the power crystal!
Ripto: Don't even try it, book-boy! Or you'll be the world's smartest pile of ashes...
Ripto: This is just what I need for a new scepter!
Elora: Hunter, do something! Quick!
Hunter: Uh... Hey, give that back! Well, I tried.
Ripto: Ahahahah! You little fools! After I destroy you all with my new scepter, I'm going to rename this place, Riptonia! Bwahahah!!

10) «What? You again?»

Ripto: Gaah! Come back here, you useless animals!
Spyro: Hey shorty, maybe I can help!
Ripto: What?! You again!
Spyro: Yep! If you want to test that power crystal, why don't you try it on me? I'll stand still, I promise.
Ripto: Hmm... I like that idea... Dragon, you've just sealed your fate!

11) «Come on, Sparx!»

Elora: I don't think we can ever thank you enough, Spyro! I suppose you have to go now?
Spyro: Yeah, I'd better, they'll be missing me in the Dragon Worlds, and I've still got a vacation to take, I need it more than ever now!
Elora: Before you go, I think that Moneybags has something he wants to give you.
Moneybags: Hmph! I most certainly do not!
Elora: Hunter! Spyro, Moneybags is very sorry that he made you pay so much on your way through Avalar, we want you to keep the gems as a reward for helping us.
Spyro: Wow, thanks! Sparx, can you grab 'em?
Professor: Let me just type in the new co-ordinates... and... there! Spyro, you can now go to Dragon Shores!
Spyro: Hey, why don't you guys come with me? I bet you could use a holiday.
Elora: I'm afraid we can't, Spyro. Ripto may be gone, but he caused a lot of damage during his short stay. We'll be cleaning up for weeks! Just remember though, that you can always get back to Avalar from Dragon Shores if you want to visit.
Spyro: Well, Ok! Come on, Sparx! We've got a lot of vacation to catch up on!
