1-1] OK Spyro, looks like we've got us a bit of a situation here. The Breezebuilders have got us pinned down and we've been waiting for a volunteer to blow up their munitions building. Looks like you're it.
2-1] Dang cannon just ain't working for me. Do you think you can blast that bird, soldier? Jump up here and give it a try.
2-2] Just hop up onto the cannon and take out that bird!
2-3] Nice shootin!
2-4] The cannon's all yours if you want it.
3-1] My name is Little Bo Peep, and I have lost my cowleks. With these battles going on all of the time, they keep running away. Can you help me get them back into my pen? &[Get 5 cowleks into the pen.
3-2] Spyro, can you help me get the cowleks back into their pen? &[Get 5 cowleks into the pen.
3-3] Thanks Spyro. Here's a little something, you know, for the effort.
3-4] I'm still waiting for those 7 cowleks. &[Get 2 more cowleks into the pen

3-6] There are two more cowleks out there somewhere, but I haven't seen them in days... &[Get 2 more cowleks into the pen.
4-1] What light from yonder window breaks? That window up there dummy. The Professor said he was working on a way to help me get back with Juliet, but I haven't seen him in a long time. &[Find the professor.
4-2] You've reunited me with Juliet! Now we can take our honeymoon in Colossus Springs and see the idols!
5-1] Romeo, Romeo, Wherefore art thou, Romeo. Oh, there's Romeo! You can have this, I don't need it anymore.
5-2] How I've missed my Romeo. If he wasn't so short, we'd get married.
6-1] Well done, my boy. Here are 2 more seeds to get you the rest of the way.
6-2] Misplaced your seeds, have you? I can make all the plants shrink again if you'd like to start over. &Would you like to start over?&Yes, please&Never mind
6-3] Off you go then.
6-4] Here you go. Be more careful with these.
6-5] Well done, my boy. Here are 2 more seeds to get you the rest of the way. Oh, and take this with you, if you don't mind. It's been cluttering up my pockets.
7-1] Spyro, my boy. I've got a magic bean, er, I mean seed for you in here somewhere. Ah, here it is. Why don't you plant it in the ground and see what grows?
7-2] Misplaced your seeds, have you? I can make all the plants shrink again if you'd like to start over. &Would you like to start over?&Yes, please&Never mind
7-3] Off you go then.
7-4] Here you go. Be more careful with this one.
7-5] Do you know the square root of 22,341?
7-6] Aiming the seed by holding down the } button will make this easier... Oh, and if you ever need your seed back, just flame the plant, and it will turn back into a seed again. &[Plant seeds to climb to Juliet.
8-1] Wow. What an explosion! It sure is a good thing I had my helmet on. Oh yeah, the Colonel wanted me to give this talisman to you if you got through the Breezebuilder defenses. Good job, soldier!
