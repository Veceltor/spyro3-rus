2-0] Please excuse our mess, Spyro... we are currently suffering from a Land Blubber infestation. First they put out the fires on our boilers, and now they've shut down our ship, too.
2-1] If you could stoke up the fires under the boilers, I'm sure you could make your way to the ship. The steam from the boilers will activate our highly advanced machines.
3-0] Thanks for getting our ship fired up, Spyro! Now we can proceed with our counter-attack on Zephyr. Please take this talisman as a token of our gratitude.
4-0] How lucky for me that you came along. My machinery is broken, and the gears I need to repair it are scattered all over the tracks. Could you hop on that trolley up there and get them? &[Collect 50 gears with the trolley.
4-1] Trouble with the trolley, eh? Well, just use the D-pad or analog stick to @4change@0 @4lanes@0, press the < button to @4jump@0, and press the { button to @4fire the cannon@0. &[Collect 50 gears. &[Use controls to change lanes, jump and shoot.
4-2] That was great work, Spyro. Now I can start fixing my machines. Here, I don't have room in my toolbox for this thing anymore.
4-3] I had the cannon installed to help me hit the @4switches@0. Try shooting the @4ringing switches@0 to see what I mean. &[Collect 50 gears. &[Try shooting arrow switches.
5-0] Those Land Blubbers have littered these metal spike mines all over the Harbor. If you can clear them out, I'll give you this orb I found in a clam yesterday. &[Shoot down the floating mines.
5-1] Thanks, Spyro. Here's that orb I promised. Sorry if it still has clam juice on it.
