You can also move quickly by charging, like Spyro. To charge, hold down the > button. Use your charge to chase down this fast enemy.

Now for the hard part. Being a maneuverable dragonfly, you can also slide in any direction. To slide, hold down the @4L1@0 or @4R1@0 button, then move with the analog stick or directional button. Try sliding up and down to hit the targets in this room.

Are you paying attention Sparx? I told you to use slide to target those crawdads. If you don't learn how to use all your skills you'll never survive the challenges that lie ahead, and Spyro would never forgive me for that. Use the @4L1@0 or @4R1@0 button, then move with the analog stick or directional button.

On your travels you'll notice butterflies that give you health, just like in the Dragon Worlds. Not only that but some butterflies will give you special powers, though only for a short time. Just eat any powerup butterfly and then press the < button to use that powerup. Your powerup is shown in the top right of the screen.

You'll be able to deal with these guys much faster if you use the powerup. Just eat any powerup butterfly and then press the < button to use that powerup. Your powerup is shown in the top right of the screen.

Looks like you're ready Sparx. If you need any more help, just choose the HELP option from the Pause Menu.

Hello Sparx, maybe before you take on the nasty crawdads I should give you some help. To start let's practice shooting. Press the { button to shoot these targets.

That looked like it hurt, maybe you should have tried to shoot them like I told you. Just press the { button to shoot the targets.
