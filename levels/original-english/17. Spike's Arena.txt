My tactical instincts told me the Sorceress would attack you here, so I flew in to help out. It seems my rocket launchers don't affect this creature, but I can assist you by dropping ammunition. Now get in there and fight the good fight!
If you charge into the lava boulders after I drop them, they'll explode against anything they hit.
Whenever you get low on health, just toast a chicken or two, and you'll soon be ship shape.
