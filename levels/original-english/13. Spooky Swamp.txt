\           That gator was mean.\          I thought I was a goner.\           Thanks for saving me.

          Our tea lamps are dark.\         Perhaps your hot dragon breath\           could set them aglow.

          No happier sight\         Have I seen, than a tea lamp\           lit by Dragonflame.

\           Beware the water.\         Snapping jaws of piranha\           claim many victims.

\           You are brave, dragon.\         Much braver than I, by far.\          Here, take this darn egg.

Come on in.\        -Sheila

\           When all lamps are lit\          there is a secret in here\            that I will show you.

\           The tea lamps are lit!\         Now I'll tell you the secret\           of what's in this house!

\           A creepy wizard\    lives inside, but hates the light.\           He has awoken.

\           He swore to destroy\        whoever lights the tea lamps.\           Better you than me. &[Use Wizard's bombs against him. &[Avoid Gators.

\           This door is jammed shut.\            Only the power of gems\             Can hope to move it. &Pay ^^^ gems to open the door? &Sure, just shut up. &No, your haiku poetry stinks.

\           You've made a wise choice...\        It will mean more eggs for you...\              And more gems for me. \           Best of all, Spyro...\        I can stop speaking Haiku.\           What a sweet relief!

\           Dad gummit, dragon.\      Just cough up those stinking gems.\           And I can go home.

\           I can't let you through.\       You're too poor to pass this door.\           Come back with more cash. &[^^^ gems needed to open door

\           Stop talking to me.\         I hate speaking in Haiku.\           Just go find some gems...

\           This swamp smells so sweet.\        The springtime trees are fragrant.\            I'm off to kick butt.

\           We have the bombs here.\         We must destroy the egg cage.\             But we just go boom.\ \           Kangaroo can help!\        You can clear the path for us!\           Will Sheila help us? &Help the firefly bombers? &Yes, I love your freestyle Haiku. &Sorry, just passing through.

\          If you clear my path\       I can blow up the egg cage.\         Poor, poor captive eggs. &Help the twin? &Yes, of course. &No more Haiku... please!

\           The eggs are all free!\          Two dragons are born today!\              Sheila's my hero.

\           Yes! It's bombing time!\         Here I come, my little eggs,\           To free you at last!!

\           We will be waiting.\        When you return to help us,\           We shall bomb again!

\           One egg cage remains.\        Will you now help my brother\           to free the last egg? &Will you help my brother now? &Yes.&No.

                 OW...\           I went boom again.\    Big rocks can be kicked, they say,\        Mushrooms must be stomped. &Help the twin? &Yes.&No.

\           Yes! It's bombing time!\         Here I come, my little eggs,\           To free you at last!! &[Kick rocks out of the way. &[Stomp on mushrooms.
